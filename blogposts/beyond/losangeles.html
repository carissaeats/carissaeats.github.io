          WELCOME TO THE CITY OF ANGELS! Having lived in the same place my whole 
          life on the East Coast, I had always been interested in life on the West Coast. 
          New York City is a very fast city - everyone is always on the move and in a rush. 
          Los Angeles is what some might consider NYC's polar opposite. SoCal is known 
          for its warmer weather throughout the year, but there's so much more to this wonderful city than just the weather. 
        </p>
        <p>
          L.A. goes at a slower pace than NYC, giving it a more relaxed feel. But, with both cities, 
          there are great things and some not-so-fantastic things. NYC is a city 
          made to be explored through public transportation and by foot, especially given 
          Manhattan's smart grid design. You pretty much <em>need</em> a car 
          to get around, which means the notorious L.A. traffic. 
        </p>
        <p>Between the two, my winner is... actually 
          L.A.!! Many will disagree, but L.A. is such an inviting, exciting city that has endless free 
          activities to enjoy and a food scene that I <em>personally</em> love more. Don't get me wrong, 
          NYC is an absolute food paradise, but I guess my taste buds are just happier in the L.A. sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my older sister, Antonia, actually goes to college in the L.A. area, so for Thanksgiving 
          2018, my dad and I went to spend time with her. We were only able to explore L.A. for about 
          three days, so we didn't get to see a whole lot, but that can be a good thing - L.A. 
          keeps me coming back for more, and that means that I have something to look forward to the 
          next time I return. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Check out the places I ate and visited during my Thanksgiving trip!
        </p>
        <h6>We went all over L.A. metro area, including San Gabriel Valley, Long Beach, 
          Hollywood, Little Tokyo, and more, so it'll definitely be a drive around!

            Eating at <a href="https://www.chinchikurin-usa.com/menu/" target="_blank" class="nounderline">
            Chinchikurin</a> was my first time trying okonomiyaki. Since then, this dish has been 
            one of my all-time favorites! They serve Hiroshima okonomiyaki, which is one of 
            two main styles of okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake with okonomi- meaning 
            "as you like" and -yaki meaning "cooked". Osaka style is a batter with all ingredients being 
            mixed inside, whereas each ingredient in the Hiroshima style is separated into its own layer, 
            allowing each layer to provide its own unique taste + texture. There's typically 11 (WOW!) layers, 
            with grilled noodles, vegetables, crepe-like batter, meat, and many more. 
          </p>
          <p>Chinchikurin offers 9 ways to eat your Hiroshima okonomiyaki, and each way has its 
            own specific toppings. My family tried 3 ways, as each pancake can be eaten as a single portion. 
            We shared the GOAM (pictured above), which is green onions and mayo, the B&C, or the basil & 
            cheese, and the Chinchikurinyaki, which has the shioburiyaki ground beef mixture inside. All 
            okonomiyakis served have "The Classic" 
            as their base, but it can also be ordered plain without toppings. However, the toppings make these pancakes 
            even more exciting! It's such a fun experience to eat here, as you're able to use the "hera" (miniature spatula) 
            to cut into the okonomiyaki that is sitting utop a heated grill. Get the B&C if you like cheese - it was my favorite!!
