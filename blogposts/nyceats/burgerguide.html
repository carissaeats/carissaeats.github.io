        <h3>the nyc burger guide</h3>
        <p><img src="/images/nyceats/burger/shakeshack2.jpg" height="400px"></p>
        <p>So to be quite honest, when I head to the city, I don't usually go eat a burger. That's not to say I don't love them, but I've only had an NYC burger a few times then and now. Regardless, I've curated a selection of my favorite burgers from the city...and it's still growing. Come back often to check if there's been any updates.</p>
        <h4>the burgers üçî:</h4>
        <h5><a href="https://5napkinburger.com/" target="_blank" class="nounderline"><strong>5 Napkin Burger</strong></a></h5>
        <div class="singleimagecontainer" align="center">
          <img src="/images/nyceats/burger/fivenap.JPG" height="250px" class="singleimage">
          <div class="singleimageoverlay">THE 5 Napkin Burger!</div>
        </div>
        <p>To say the least, this burger was life-changing. As you can see, this burger is <em>smothered</em> in their signature rosemary-garlic aioli. Their name-brand burger has a 10-oz patty, imported gruyere, caramelized onions, and that thick, creamy aioli. I usually have an issue with restaurant patties, because thick patties done wrong can give off a rubbery texture and dry feel. With the 5 Napkin Burger on the other hand, the patty oozes juice and is grilled & seasoned to perfection. All the flavors mesh amazingly together üòã</p>
        <h5><a href="http://www.ramenburger.com/" target="_blank" class="nounderline"><strong>Ramen Burger</strong></a></h5>
        <p><img src="/images/nyceats/burger/ramenburger.JPG" height="400px"></p>
        <p>Listen, I know some people are firm believers that the ramen burger is just an Instagram food and that they don't actually taste good. But...I actually really love this burger. The ramen buns are made from fresh noodles, and when bitten into, give off a crispy noodle texture as well as a slight chew. The burger patty itself is nothing special, but the sauce, ooooooohhhh. The "secret shoyu sauce" that tops every original ramen burger is essentially a soy sauce reduction with a bunch of super secret ingredients along with it. While I might never get to find out what's inside that reduction, I would gladly top any dish with it.</p>
        <p>Sure, the ramen burger is an Instagram food, but it's not one to be skipped. It's an extremely enjoyable experience, and I stand by this burger üçú. </p>
        <h5><a href="https://shakeshack.com/" target="_blank" class="nounderline"><strong>Shake Shack</strong></a></h5>
        <div class="singleimagecontainer" align="center">
          <img src="/images/nyceats/burger/shakeshack.jpg" height="250px" class="singleimage">
          <div class="singleimageoverlay">My dad really wanted to show off the new Vessel...üòÇ</div>
        </div>
        <p>This one needs no explanation. It's a burger we all know and love and such a quick option that doesn't compromise quality. The shack sauce is simply amazing and makes every burger worth eating. Pictured are the Shack Stack burgers, which are the original shack burgers topped with the same crisp-fried portobello mushrooms filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheese from their 'Shroom burger.</p>
