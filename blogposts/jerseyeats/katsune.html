          <a href="https://katsuneusa.business.site/" class="nounderline">Katsune Donkatsu Café</a> is a modest counter-serve cafe setting decorated only by picnic-patterned tables. 
            <em>Katsu</em> is a popular Japanese (or Korean) deep fried panko breaded meat cutlet served with "Bull Dog" tonkatsu sauce,
           a sauce sweetened with fruit and vegetables from Japan. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Katsune is the only Bergen County restaurant specifically dedicated to katsu-style dishes, and they've mastered it. 
          It's evident that the restaurant makes their own breadcrumbs, as they are different than the typical store bought panko, with lengthier and flatter panko 
          that make their katsu flakier than all. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The café serves up the standard pork donkatsu, as well as the famous cheese pork "Cordon Bleu" donkatsu, chicken, 
          shrimp (ebi), menchi (beef and pork patty) katsu dishes.
          They also serve up a "Wang Donkatsu", a much larger, even crispier, pounded flat donkatsu. 
          A side of made-in-house curry can be added to all dishes too. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Their cheese donkatsu comes with a generous stuffing of mozzarella cheese that makes for the picture-perfect cheese pull. 
          Katsune also keeps their pork tenderloin so juicy after frying, something that's difficult to accomplish in deep-fried meat dishes. 
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          All dishes are served with a side of steamed white rice, corn, Japanese-style coleslaw, and soy sauce pickles.
          They are also accompanied by the standard "Bull Dog" tonkatsu sauce, as well as a homemade banana sauce that's surprisingly addictive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unassuming exterior of the restaurant might not bring you in right away, but 
          the flakiest katsu in Bergen County (maybe even in the NYC area...) makes this a place 
          you'll regret not eating at. Katsune Donkatsu for the win!
        </p>
        <p>See you soon,</p>
        <p>Carissa 😊</p>
