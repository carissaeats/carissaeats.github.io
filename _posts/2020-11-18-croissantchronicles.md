I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, she's only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, I've been itching to try making them too. It's month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company.

### Croissants From Scratch
###### Yields 8 medium croissants, but you can make ~16 smaller ones instead

**Ingredients**
* ¾ cup lukewarm milk
* ⅛ cup packed brown sugar
* 1½ tsp active dry yeast
* 3½ cups all-purpose flour *(may need as little as 3¼ or as much as 4 cups)*
* ¾ cup salted butter *if using unsalted butter, add ½ tbsp salt*
* ½ egg for egg wash

**Directions**
1. Lightly stir lukewarm milk, brown sugar, and yeast with a fork in your mixing bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy. 
1. Add flour (and salt, **if using unsalted butter**) to the bowl ½ cup at a time, and mix until soft, elastic, but still a little bit sticky. 
      * Start off with a sturdy spatula, then move on to kneading with your hands.
