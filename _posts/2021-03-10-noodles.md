Yup, you read that right. Noodles. In virtually every culture, an iconic noodle dish exists -- Italian *pasta*, Japanese *udon*, Korean *japchae*, Jewish *kugel*, Singaporean *laksa*, Filipino *pancit* -- you get the point. So where did this versatile ingredient / base originate? What was the catalyst for its widespread popularity? How are noodles the foundation to many fusion cuisines? How can plant-based eaters enjoy this dish that’s typically accompanied by meat? And then I’m excited to share my dream noodle list.

If you don’t know I love noodles, *udon know me*. Be prepared for all the noodle puns I could think of (and find online).
