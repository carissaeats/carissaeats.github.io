In virtually every culture, an iconic noodle dish exists -- Italian *pasta*, Japanese *udon*, Korean *japchae*, Singaporean *laksa*, Filipino *pancit*, Dominican *espaguetis* -- you get the point.

If you don’t know I love noodles, *udon know me*. Be prepared for all the noodle puns I could think of (and find online).
