*Humm*-us where the heart is.

I get a little carried away with the puns during recipe posts, so bear with me.

My family had some pantry stuff we wanted to consume right away, so I came up with the idea to make a three-ish piece platter, with homemade pita, eggs in purgatory (kinda), and avocado hummus! The recipes for all three components will be posted within the next week! You won't wanna miss my (almost) vegan platter.
