**[Katsune Donkatsu Café](https://katsuneusa.business.site/){:class="nounderline" target="_blank"}** is a modest counter-serve café setting decorated only by picnic-patterned tables. Katsu is a popular Japanese/Korean deep fried panko breaded meat cutlet served with "Bull Dog" tonkatsu sauce, a Japanese sauce sweetened with fruit and vegetables.

Katsune is one of the few Bergen County restaurants totally dedicated to katsu-style dishes, and they've mastered it. The restaurant has lengthier and flatter panko breadcrumbs that make their katsu flakier than all. 

The café serves up the standard pork donkatsu, as well as the famous **cheese "Cordon Bleu" donkatsu** (pork - *pictured below*), chicken, ebi (shrimp), beef and pork patty (menchi) katsu dishes. They also serve up a "Wang Donkatsu", a much larger, even crispier, pounded flat donkatsu. A side of made-in-house curry can be added to all dishes too.

Their cheese donkatsu comes with a generous stuffing of mozzarella cheese that makes for the picture-perfect cheese pull. Katsune also keeps their pork tenderloin so juicy after frying, something that's difficult to accomplish in deep-fried meat dishes.

All dishes are served with a side of steamed white rice, corn, Japanese-style coleslaw, and soy sauce pickles. They are also accompanied by the standard "Bull Dog" tonkatsu sauce, as well as a homemade banana sauce that's surprisingly addictive.

The unassuming exterior of the restaurant might not bring you in right away, but the flakiest katsu in Bergen County (maybe even in the NYC area...) makes this a place you'll regret not eating at. Katsune Donkatsu for the win!
