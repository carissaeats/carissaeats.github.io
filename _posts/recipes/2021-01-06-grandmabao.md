[Watch Antonia's ~cinematography~ of our grandma making baozi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GajgDBZeoQ&t=3s&ab_channel=bub){:class="nounderline" target="_blank"}! Please like, comment, and subscribe to the *[bub YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqH5MDmErneKqkCnYxBGnEA){:class="nounderline" target="_blank"}*, where she posts vlogs from her apartment provided by her internship, and I even make a cameo once in a while for our "[bake w/ bubs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr-C5XyXq8c2sFUzGIP5w5HxpAtvWgYF){:class="nounderline" target="_blank"}" series! The recipe is transcribed by Antonia, as my grandma speaks in Cantonese throughout. 

I promised Antonia I would promo her videos, because she really works beyond hard on each and every one of them! Between the cover art and animations she creates, she really deserves all the love.
