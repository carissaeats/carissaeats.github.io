Life update: I've moved to The Swamp!

Now, I'm pursuing my Master of Public Health at the University of Florida. From being here for just a couple months at this point, I already absolutely love it here. I'm a mere 1.5 hour away from home, meaning I see my grandma and dad way more often. Gainesville is lined with trees and endless outdoors to explore, which has been a beautfiul thing to experience. I've also been able to incorporate sustainable habits that I've been looking to do so with convenience and affordability for years – like shopping at a refillery (shoutout to the best, [Life Unplastic]({{site.url}}){:class="nounderline"}), supporting local markets, and composting. I've started cooking and baking so much more – I got a stand mixer off of Marketplace that has proved to be one of the best investments of the year. I've picked up crochet and committed to playing more pickleball as a solo at local courts. And most importantly, I've met some of the kindest people ever and cultivated a wonderful support network here. I was nervous to move to Florida, considering it's highly polarizing political climate, but I've found people who are truly driven to make a difference, and it's exactly what I was hoping to find in coming to a public health program at Florida's flagship university. It just feels like I finally have all the ingredients I've been looking for to invest in myself and create the life I've always dreamed of. 

I'm also renting a house here in Gainesville with two people I found on Facebook, and it has been so much fun. House renting with friends has been a dream that I'm so grateful to be fulfilling now – special shoutout to my room. I feel pretty proud of my poster collection – here's one wall that I'm particularly proud of!

So I'm excited to show everyone all the lovely places and things that have made Gainesville feel like home in such a short time. It has so much more than meets the eye – from food to activities, I've been having a blast exploring the scene here. Stay tuned for more cooking and baking updates – I've been feeling extra inspired since coming here to create some fun combinations 😆

Also, if you happen to be a reader that I haven't been in touch with recently – even if it's been a while, I would love to hear from you! Especially if you're planning to visit Florida at any point – there's few things I love more than showing people from my other worlds the place I call home now.
