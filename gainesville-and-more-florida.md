title: "Gainesville (and more Florida!)"
description: Calling Gainesville my new home! This historic city goes so far beyond a college town – it has incredible eats, sights, and the cutest trinket shops. Blink and you'll miss the diverse cuisine and endless shops that'll make you feel part of this wonderful community.

I've moved to The Swamp!

Follow along for my adventures in Gainesville, a city that meets way more than the eye. Community feels ever so present in here, and I can't wait to take you all along as I explore all the food, sights, local businesses, and history that this city has to offer. 

My other travels around Florida will also be included on this page, but Gainesville is my homebase at the moment 🐊
