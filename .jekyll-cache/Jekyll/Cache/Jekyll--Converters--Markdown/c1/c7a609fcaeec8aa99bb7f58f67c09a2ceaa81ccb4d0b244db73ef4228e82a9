<p>Hey everyone! So Iâ€™ve been pretty MIA on here and on Instagram, so I just wanted to keep you all updated on where Iâ€™ve been.</p>

<p>I do have a lot on my mind, regarding where Iâ€™m at and what I want to do, so bear with me while I explain.</p>

<p><strong>First big thing</strong>: Iâ€™m moving. Iâ€™ll be going to college next year, but my dad is also moving! Iâ€™ve lived in [redacted town, out of an abundance of caution] my entire life, and itâ€™s rather bittersweet to move. On one hand, Iâ€™ve always felt safe living in my house, which has been a huge privilege to have. This town is the only place Iâ€™ve ever known as â€œhomeâ€, which is a true luxury that many people yearn for. While my sister and I took our daily walk the other day, I began reminiscing on all of the staples in my town: the multitude of pizza shops, the (now-closed) cookware store, the diner, among many others.</p>

<p>And then, thereâ€™s the â€œsweetâ€ part of moving: I would love a fresh start. My family was actually supposed to move three years ago, but those plans fell through. My family went through a big loss nearly five years ago, and the house sometimes feels like a never-ending reminder of that loss and all events leading up to it. Plus, the opportunity to have a fresh start feels more appealing than ever, since the last year has felt very stagnant due to the pandemic â€“ which is absolutely not a terrible thing â€“ but to have the ability to move by choice is exciting. Weâ€™ll be heading to Orlando, which I can only imagine will be a bit of a culture shock. Although I donâ€™t live in the most diverse place, Iâ€™m still surrounded by a lot of people who look like me. Weâ€™ll be living in a suburb in the Orlando metro area, so itâ€™ll just be a peaceful summer at a new home. So <a href="https://www.publix.com/shop-online/in-store-pickup" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Publix</a>, here I come!</p>

<p>We could be moving anytime from mid-May to mid-June, so packing time has commenced! Packing the home youâ€™ve lived in for 17 years is bound to have 17 years worth of stuff (x4 for everyone who lives here), and we are <em>that</em> hoarding family. I would love to spend my free time working on this blog, but until we get up out of this house, most of my time will go to packing. July and August will be months of weekly blogging at the minimum, though, I promise!</p>
