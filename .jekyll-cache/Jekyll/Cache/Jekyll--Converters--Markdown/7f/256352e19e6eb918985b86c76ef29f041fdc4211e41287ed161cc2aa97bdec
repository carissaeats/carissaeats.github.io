<p>From Los Angeles to the Caribbean, chef Rashida Holmes pays homage to her Afro-Caribbean roots with this Bajan and Trinidadian family-run spot. I was immediately greeted with a mural of exactly who they are and what they stand for: joy, flavor, love, heritage, innovation, and community. No restaurant has to share their values, but Bridgetown Rotiâ€™s effort to share theirs set me up with the calm energy I needed for the feast I was about to enjoy.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon Bridgetown Roti back in September 2022, when the concept was just a pop-up achieving their dreams and accomplishing even more. Appearing as a local celebrity chef at the USC Annenberg 50th Anniversary evening celebration, Rashida served up small plates of green curry head-on shrimp cucumber chutney roti chips, curried yam and mango mini patties, and pineapple upside-down cake.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ate this plate a little too long ago to have a solid review of it, but I will say this much â€“ after eating Rashidaâ€™s food that day, I have been a loyal follower, previously mapping out a multiple bus route to their former residence in the shared space, Crafted Kitchen, and staying posted for updates on the brick-and-mortar Rashida dreamed of opening.</p>

<p>And this dream took <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9d4WskvECr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">official flight on July 20th, 2024</a>! Big day for Bridgetown Roti fans. So on my first brick-and-mortar visit just a week ago, I felt honored to be the first customer of the day! Truthfully, I do love me some takeout, but I figured it was worthwhile to stay in the environment I had waited so long to enjoy her food in. Lined with vibrant decorative Bahama shutters and a massive patty warmer, Bridgetown Roti convinces you to stay without even asking. After all, the establishment is set up as a counter-serve, so its purpose is more of a good time rather than a long time. But once the beautifully arranged tray of food arrived, I sat peacefully in my decision to stay.</p>

<p>I was devastated to find out that their doubles, which are staples of Trinidadian cuisine, were only served on Sundays and Mondays, but like any place I dearly love â€“ one item missed just means one more reason to return. At a place with enough options to make my indecision sound off, no doubles, no problem.</p>

<p>The handmade roti is flaky, with an unmistakable fat-laden composition to it. I was trying to figure out if it was vegetable shortening, oil, ghee, or butter, but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqbSUuYDjuU" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Eater video</a> with Rashida cooking up this exact dish shows her use of butter. Scraping softened butter with her fingers and rubbing it across the top of the roti, Rashida demonstrates food is a labor of love. While other parts of the roti-making process require scales to produce exact measurements â€“ like when Rashida measures out exactly 120 grams of dough â€“ the amount of butter to add is something she just feels out with her own ten fingers. A thin wrap would not be able to withstand the saucy goat â€“ cooked two ways â€“ but a thick wrap would dominate the dish in which multiple elements should share the spotlight. Rashida, the master of roti, finds the perfect balance. And after hours of sitting in my fridge, the leftover half of this wrap was still perfectly intact â€“ minimal roti was soaked in the juices, and it did not disintegrate like other wraps that fail the test of time.</p>

<p>The tender red pepper goat, seasoned with Rashidaâ€™s curry blend that she purposefully proportioned, was accented by the aforementioned peanut sauce. My immediate reaction was a desire for a stronger peanut taste (I love peanuts), but I remembered there were more guests at this party to make room for.</p>

<p>Rashida also explains in the video that the fried potato is an ode to the potatoes in traditional curries. I loved this twist (and crisp), but found myself wishing that this curry-inspired potato remembered its roots. In potato curries, the potatoes are like sponges, soaking in every dimension of the broth and infused with spice in most bites. I would want this potato to be smothered with one more gesture of love. But if my only critique of this wrap was a slightly under seasoned potato, then we might as well be splitting hairs.</p>

<p>This roti was decadent, but the ample portion of slaw stuffed inside this juicy wrap was like the sun peeking out of an already delicious rainbow; the roti is a beautiful sight (and eat) itself, but with a brightness we all cherish.</p>

<p>Since I was already committed to a roti with pulled meat, I was initially leaning towards the green curry shrimp patty in hopes of diversifying my protein for this meal. As much as I wish I could say all my choices were original opinions, I fell victim to the crowdâ€™s opinions â€“ the ones found on no other than TikTok â€“ and the people said I could not miss the oxtail patty.</p>
