<p>Welcome to my new recipe series, where I‚Äôm highlighting BIPOC creatives in the food industry!</p>

<p>This first release of the BIPOC Recipe Series spotlights Black recipe creators. I chose mostly independent creatives, because independent creatives have complete control over their narratives, meaning they are Black stories told by Black people. So without further ado, here are a few food storytelling communities comprised of Black voices.</p>

By looking through the lens of cuisine, people can learn about culture. ‚ÄúAll roads to lead to Africa‚Äù for Jikoni.</li>
