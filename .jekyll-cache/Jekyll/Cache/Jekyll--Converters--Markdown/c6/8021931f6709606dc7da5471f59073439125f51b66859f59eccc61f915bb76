<p>Every Wednesday, USC invites vendors who sell anything from jewelry, fresh-baked goods, locally-grown produce, sauces, dips, and prepared foods.</p>

<p>If you know me, you know I am a Trojan Farmers Market <strong>pad Thai</strong> fan first, human second!</p>

<p>You can order it with or without the chicken pictured, and itâ€™s absolutely delicious either way. A full plate of pad Thai is $8, while a pad Thai + chicken runs at $13. The first time I had it, I could tell it had been sitting out for a whileâ€¦yet it still tasted fantastic. The next few times, it came out looking as smooth and soft as it looks pictured here. If you like peanuts, I highly suggest eating the chicken with the peanut sauce they provide. The chicken is already so flavorful, but the peanut sauce balances it out by adding a dimension of sweetness.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Thai tea</strong> is also great! At $5, it is a bit on the pricier side, but on a 100Â° Wednesday, I never regret getting it if I can!</p>

<p>These pupusas run at $4 apiece, regardless of the filling inside. Iâ€™ve tried the <strong>pupusas con pollo, vegetales, y queso</strong> (chicken, vegetables, &amp; cheese), as well as the <strong>pupusas con carne asada y queso</strong> (steak &amp; cheese). They are served with a side of curtido, a Salvadoran fermented cabbage, carrot, onion, and hot pepper slaw, as well as crema SalvadoreÃ±a if youâ€™d like. Crispy, savory, and cheesy, pupusas make me feel so happy. I mean, just look at that crispy cheese skirt!! Theyâ€™re a great grab-and-go meal on busy Wednesdays, making it convenient, filling, and satisfying.</p>

<p>Life is (scallop) *dynamite*.</p>

<p>This is what I would consider the most unique</p>
