<p>It’s hard to say I’m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian-American. I’m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because I’m of Chinese descent, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian – I “look” Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian-American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>There’s no look to being Asian-American! And for those who proudly identify as Asian-American, it’s dehumanizing to hear that you don’t look Asian or to get the “no way you’re Asian” response. It’s stripping away a piece of someone’s identity.</p>
