<p><strong><a href="https://www.patisserieflorentine.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Patisserie Florentine</a></strong> (PF) is an extremely popular Bergen County breakfast, brunch, and lunch destination that serves up French-inspired dishes, baked goods, and freshly brewed coffee drinks.  <!-- MORE --></p>

<p>Ever since discovering this spot a few years back, it has become a favorite of mine. The unique part of this brunch spot is the twists it puts on classic American brunch staples, like eggs Benedict and French toast. PF truly elevates classics by incorporating in French techniques and bringing in the freshest ingredients and artisanal items.</p>

<p>The service is pretty uninvolved, yet the lively ambience, glass display of bakery items, simple wooden decor, and natural sunlight somehow make up for it. I’ve just barely scratched the surface of their extensive menu…but I’ve never left a meal from PF unsatisfied, so I’m ecstatic to share a few of the dishes I’ve enjoyed below.</p>

<h5 id="belgian-waffles">Belgian Waffles</h5>

<p>The portion for the price ($12.25) is a little small, nonetheless, this dish is fantastic. Waffles are great, but my favorite kind are liège-style, which are yeast-risen brioche waffles covered with pearl sugar bits. Liège waffles are so chewy, yet slightly crispy on the outside thanks to the pearl sugar studs. You can choose how you want your waffles to be topped - bananas + caramel sauce OR fresh berries + chocolate sauce. Shown above is the banana + caramel sauce combination, but they added blueberries anyways, probably due to excess. Their caramel sauce is SO INCREDIBLE!</p>

<h5 id="croissant-oeufs-fromage">Croissant Oeufs Fromage</h5>

<p>Toasted croissant slices, avocado puree, melted mozzarella, gravlax (cured salmon), all topped off with two sunny side up eggs! Think of it like an elevated avocado toast with lox’s cousin, gravlax. The mozzarella cheese seems like an odd combo, with it being fish and cheese, but it all works so well together. One of the more underrated items at PF is the side salad that comes with many of the savory dishes. The dressing meshes so well with the mixed greens, and it makes for a great palate cleanser between bites.</p>

<h5 id="omelette-royale">Omelette Royale</h5>

</div>

<p>It’s not exactly a French rolled omelette, but it is folded vertically and stuffed with your choice of toppings. The omelette is accompanied by pommes florentine (roasted potatoes), that crispy Israeli side salad, and a brioche roll with marmalade and garlic butter. This dish is arguably the biggest bang for your buck - $11.75 for this omelette that can barely fit on the plate AND served with a generous portion of sides! Here’s a tip: spread some of that garlic butter for the roll onto the potatoes &amp; omelette!</p>

<h5 id="briochette-french-toast">Briochette (French Toast)</h5>

<div class="singleimagecontainer">

<p>This toast has a custardy filling that makes for the perfect bite. The star of this dish, though, is the vanilla anglaise, a dessert pouring custard sauce, which softens up the toast a little bit. Don’t be shy to ask for extra anglaise!!</p>

<p>I’ve also tried some of their desserts, like the Fondant au Chocolat Noir and Gateaux Almandine. If you aren’t feeling too hungry, these desserts are great to fill that void, but you’ll probably feel content after devouring any of their dishes.</p>

<p>This brunch stop gets really busy over the weekend, but I usually don’t have any trouble getting a table. PF has a lengthy menu that is sure to satisfy whatever cravings you have - sandwiches, breakfast staples, baked goods, decadent desserts, and even pasta!</p>
