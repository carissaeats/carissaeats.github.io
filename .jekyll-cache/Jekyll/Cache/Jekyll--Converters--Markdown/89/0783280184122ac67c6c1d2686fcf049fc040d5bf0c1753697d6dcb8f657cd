<p>I’ve learned to cook with my grandma, as well as through watching lots of Youtube and my favorite Food Network stars, but I still have so much to learn.</p>

<h3 id="see-some-of-the-stories-behind-my-favorite-foods-here">See some of the stories behind my favorite foods here.</h3>

<p>I think food is the one thing that is able to connect so many people. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, it’s very likely that you guys have had some similar food experiences.</p>

<p>With cooking comes many different stories, and living in America has allowed me to experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places.</p>

<p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>

<p>My goal for this webpage is to share some of my favorite places to find ~affordable eats~ (no Michelin-star meals here!). Food is something I’m so grateful to be able to enjoy every day, and I just want to capture the best moments. Whether it be cooking with my grandma or exploring tasty eats, it is something I hope everyone can enjoy along with me.</p>

<p>I’ve been blessed with numerous travel opportunities, and food has undoubtedly been my favorite part of every experience, 
whether it’s eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or shakshuka in Israel. My <strong><a href="/beyond.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">beyond</a></strong> page will share the destinations!</p>
