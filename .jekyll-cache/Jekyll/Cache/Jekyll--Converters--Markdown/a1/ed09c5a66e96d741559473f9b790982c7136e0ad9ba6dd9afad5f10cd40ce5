<p>Being Chinese-American is a part of my identity that I’m learning to embrace more and more every day. While I was born in New Jersey, both my parents immigrated to America from China (Guangdong Province). Heck, even my sister was born in Canada, so <em>technically</em>, I’m the first American-born Chinese in my family, even if my sister has pretty much lived in the states her whole life. But yeah, I love being Chinese</p>
