<p><em>Humm</em>-us where the heart is.</p>

<p>I get a little carried away with the puns during recipe posts, so bear with me.</p>

<p>This past Sunday, I found myself with a little more time to relax than I usual have. Cooking, along with the subsequent eating, is pretty therapeutic for me, and my family had some pantry stuff we wanted to consume right away. So I came up with the idea to make a three+ piece platter, with pita, eggs in purgatory (kinda), and avocado hummus!</p>
