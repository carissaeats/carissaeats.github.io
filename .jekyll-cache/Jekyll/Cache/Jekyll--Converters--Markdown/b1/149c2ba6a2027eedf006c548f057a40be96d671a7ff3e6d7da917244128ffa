<p>Being Chinese-American is a part of my identity that I’m learning to embrace more and more every day. While I was born in New Jersey, both my parents immigrated to America from China (Guangdong Province). Heck, even my sister was born in Canada, so <em>technically</em>, I’m the first American-born Chinese in my family, even if my sister has pretty much lived in the states her whole life. But yeah, I love being Chinese, although I haven’t always embraced that. I want to be as specific as possible when discussing this piece of my identity, as although I am Asian-American, I can’t speak on behalf of people of other Asian ethnic groups, and I know that Asian-American isn’t always the most inclusive term. This is also just my personal experience that I’ve been really wanting to talk about for a while, but maybe some people can relate.</p>

<p>As a young-ing, I went to Mandarin language school for a few years. Unfortunately, I never picked it up. Since it’s typically easier to learn languages as a kid, students with parents who spoke Mandarin around them could absorb the newer material at Mandarin school. My parents spoke Cantonese around me, which is another widespread Chinese dialect, although it’s popularity may be waning a bit. Even then, I’m still not fluent in Cantonese, but I would consider myself conversational. My grandma has been “permanently” living with me since 2014 (I think), so she definitely helps me practice my Cantonese. I would love to pick up Mandarin in the near future, so I hope to dedicate my next summer to learning Mandarin.</p>

<p>The language has been a major point of contention in my journey as a Chinese-American. People in my life have made me feel less Chinese than them since I don’t speak Mandarin, and I’m pretty positive the parents in my town’s Chinese community don’t love that about me. Does speaking the “mother tongue” make someone Chinese? I’m not sure, but I feel ashamed about it sometimes. It feels like a competition with other Chinese-Americans to be the “most Chinese”, but I’m starting to realize (as cheesy at it sounds) that it’s not a competition with others, it’s about being better than</p>
