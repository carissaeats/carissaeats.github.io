<p>Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pinklady Cheese Tart</a></strong> is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.</p>

<p>When I was in Taiwan, I got to try a boba-filled cheese tart - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. But although the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese that really stood out. Since then, Iâ€™ve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me. When I saw <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmiUUdHTPM/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">this post</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeaniuseats/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">@jeaniuseats</a>, I was ECSTATIC!! The location of Pinklady was perfect, as my dad and I stop by Mott Street almost monthly, so I made it a target stop on our next trip.</p>

<p>Pinklady may not be the first cheese tart in Manhattan, but they are one of the only businesses really specializing in cheese tarts. They only sell two products, one being their array of tarts, and the other being their housemade rice yogurt drinks, which Iâ€™ve heard lovely things about too.</p>

<p>You might be unfamiliar with the Hokkaido cheese tarts that Pinklady is inspired by. Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island, has a massive countryside that can support a successful dairy industry. According to <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5312.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">japan-guide.com</a>, half of Japanâ€™s milk is produced on this island, and their dairy products are highly regarded in across the country. The tarts supposedly originated in a bakery in Hokkaidoâ€™s capital of Sapporo, obviously using those quality dairy products. Hokkaido is one of my top bucket-list destinations, not only for the food, but for the nature, hot springs, flowers, skiing, and so much more.</p>

The parmesan does NOT make these tarts savory - I think that a small amount adds slight saltiness and nuttiness that balances the sweetness of this dessert.</h6>

<p>The storeâ€™s giant yellow sign sticks out like a sore thumb on Chinatownâ€™s â€œunofficial Main Streetâ€ thatâ€™s packed with the lucky Chinese color of red. Thereâ€™s no seating inside, which I wouldnâ€™t expect to change after the pandemic, given the storeâ€™s small space. Thereâ€™s a few back-of-the-house staff, but itâ€™s been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times Iâ€™ve been there.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, which is not always an easy find at bakeries and restaurants.</p>

<p>Well anyways, youâ€™ll see that there are â€œsneeze guardâ€ dividers to protect the tarts from any customers (who must wear a mask inside too), and the tarts are lined up on Silpats and plastic trays. They currently offer five flavors of <strong>original cheese</strong>, <strong>matcha</strong>, <strong>ube</strong> (purple yam), <strong>chocolate</strong>, and <strong>strawberry-filled chocolate</strong>. Iâ€™ve tried all, but the chocolate one, since Iâ€™m not the <em>biggest</em> fan of chocolate (Iâ€™m prepared to get some hate mailâ€¦). My favorite is the matcha, because the strong matcha flavor really does shine through, but you really canâ€™t go wrong with any of these.</p>

<p>Now, about those temperatures I was talking about, there four ways to enjoy these tarts. Itâ€™s almost like four different dessert types that range from firm, cheesecake-like to lava cake. Putting the tart in the fridge will make the flowy inside firm up like a cheesecake, while putting it in the oven / air-fryer will make the inside ooze of lava cheese.</p>

<p>Opening at the peak of the pandemic in April is no easy feat, and although there are many old establishments in Chinatown that deserve an equal amount of appreciation, Pinklady is a great addition to an already fantastic neighborhood dessert scene. Be sure to pay a visit at your next stop in Chinatown!</p>
