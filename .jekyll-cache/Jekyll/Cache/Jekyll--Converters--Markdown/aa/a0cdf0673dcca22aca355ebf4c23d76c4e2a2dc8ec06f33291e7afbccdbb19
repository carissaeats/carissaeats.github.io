I"\<p>I’m honored and excited to finally announce that I’m a partner for the exclusive launch of IRVINS Salted Egg Salmon Fish Skin chips!</p>

<p>IRVINS Salted Egg chips turned a signature <em>Salted Egg Crab</em> dish, which became a local River Valley phenomenon, into some #DangerouslyAddictive snacks. Perfectly stated straight from their website:</p>

<h5 id="tldr-started-from-a-restaurant-now-were-here">TLDR: Started from a restaurant. Now <em>we’re</em> here.</h5>

<p>These chips are made with the follow ultra-fresh ingredients, straight from their website:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Salted duck egg yolk, a familiar ingredient commonly used in Asian dishes.</li>
  <li>Curry leaves, bringing out the fragrance in our snacks.</li>
  <li>Red chili pepper, giving our snacks a slight kick while enhancing the salted egg taste.
