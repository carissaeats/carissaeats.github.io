I"+<p>Iâ€™ve headed out west to go to college! Living in Los Angeles has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didnâ€™t know this dream would become my reality so soon!</p>

<p>I visited my sister in LA in 2018 (<a href="/beyond/losangeles" class="nounderline">I wrote a recap here</a>), and I still reflect on it as one of the happiest weekends of my life. And the best part is, my love for this city has only grown.</p>

<p>I have no clue where the next few years will take me, but I do know what I want to prioritize in the future:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Highlighting the stories behind foods</li>
  <li>Learning the history behind a variety of cuisines</li>
  <li>Expanding my palate</li>
  <li>Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be</li>
  <li>Connecting with small businesses</li>
  <li>Empathizing with more diverse groups of people</li>
</ol>

<p>Come back soon to catch some of my fun adventures over the last few months ðŸ˜Š I love you, LA!</p>
