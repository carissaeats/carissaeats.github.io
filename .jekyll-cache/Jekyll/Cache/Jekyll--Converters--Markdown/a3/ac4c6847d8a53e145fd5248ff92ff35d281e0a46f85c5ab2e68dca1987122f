<p>I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, she‚Äôs only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, I‚Äôve been itching to try making them too. It‚Äôs month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company. Catch the full post, coming by the end of November!</p>
