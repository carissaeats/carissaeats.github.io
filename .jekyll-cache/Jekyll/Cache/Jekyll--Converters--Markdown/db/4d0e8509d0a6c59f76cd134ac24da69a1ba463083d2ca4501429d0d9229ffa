I"°<p>Iâ€™ve moved to The Swamp!</p>

<p>Follow along for my adventures in Gainesville, a city that meets way more than the eye. Community feels ever so present in here, and I canâ€™t wait to take you all along as I explore all the food, sights, local businesses, and history that this city has to offer.</p>

<p>My other travels around Florida will also be included on this page, but Gainesville is my homebase at the moment ğŸŠ</p>
