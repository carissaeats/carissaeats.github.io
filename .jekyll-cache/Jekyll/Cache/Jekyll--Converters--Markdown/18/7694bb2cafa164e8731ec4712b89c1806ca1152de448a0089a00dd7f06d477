<p>Meet the restaurant that made me realize how good the Cantonese food could be in Orlando.</p>

<p>And since my first time eating here, Iâ€™ve been nothing short of impressed by the Cantonese restaurants in this city.</p>

<p>During fall 2021, I would say my family went here once or twice a week. Itâ€™s not uncommon for Cantonese people to go to dim sum daily. People go with two or three friends, and they split a pot of <em>cha</em> and two or three dim sum dishes. Dim sum is designed to be shared â€” a steamer of <em>siumaai</em> may come with three pieces, for example. People may do this as an morning or afternoon snack, making dim sum an easy, delicious excuse to see friends! Whenever we went to Ten Ten, we often saw some of the same people with the same trusty two or three steamers of dim sum.</p>
