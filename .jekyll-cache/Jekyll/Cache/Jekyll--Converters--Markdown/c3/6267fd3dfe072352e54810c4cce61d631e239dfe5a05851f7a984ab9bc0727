<p>I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, sheâ€™s only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, Iâ€™ve been itching to try making them too. Itâ€™s month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company.</p>

<h6 id="yields-8-medium-croissants-but-you-can-make-12-smaller-ones-instead">Yields 8 medium croissants, but you can make ~12 smaller ones instead</h6>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup tapioca flour</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons warm melted butter</li>
  <li>â…“ cup milk or soy milk</li>
  <li>â…“ cup grated Parmesan or gouda cheese (more or less, based on your preferred cheesiness)</li>
  <li>1 beaten egg</li>
  <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>â…› teaspoon of granulated garlic (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to 375Â°F, or 190Â°C.</li>
  <li>Combine milk, warm melted butter, beaten egg, and salt.
    <ul>
      <li>Be sure to thoroughly mix, as you do not want the egg to cook at all.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stir in the tapioca flour in two parts and mix until smooth.
    <ul>
      <li>Luckily, you donâ€™t have to worry about overmixing as you would with regular bread, since thereâ€™s no gluten in this recipe!</li>
      <li>Combining tapioca flour and liquids can create a slimy texture, so you may struggle to mix at first.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the cheese of your choice and stir well.
    <ul>
      <li>Iâ€™ve only tried Parmesan and gouda, but any lower-moisture cheeses would definitely work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fill each mold basically full, but not to the point where any batter spreads out of the individual cup.</li>
  <li>Bake until the tops are lightly golden brown for 15-20 minutes. Arenâ€™t they <em>cheesy</em> on the eyes?
    <ul>
      <li>Because of the butter and oils from the cheese, the breads should come right out of a non-stick muffin tray.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Serve with honey, jam, or marinara sauce.</li>
</ol>
