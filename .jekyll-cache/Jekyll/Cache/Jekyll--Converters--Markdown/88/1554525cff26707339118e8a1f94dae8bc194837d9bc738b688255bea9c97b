<p>Serving up everything from teri buns to Korean-style ramen to mixed tempura, <a href="http://misoteriyaki.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Miso Teriyaki</a> entered the Bergen County dining scene in March 2020. When I saw a teriyaki restaurant coming to Tenafly, it dawned on me that I haven‚Äôt had teriyaki in years. Apparently, it‚Äôs the unofficial signature dish of Seattle, which now makes me regret not eating it when I had the opportunity to go there.</p>

<p>But alas, Miso arrived and according to their logo, they‚Äôre based in Seattle! I don‚Äôt know their full story, but I would love to interview them and get the full scoop on their roots and why they decided to bring the West Coast over to <em>cold Jersey</em>.</p>

<p>Above, you can see their hand trimmed, char-broiled beef teriyaki, which from some angles, kind of just looks like cooked beef. But wow, it packs a punch!

<p>Okay, vegetable galore in this noodle dish. The amount of veggies in their yakisoba would be my criticism, but not for a dislike of veggies!! I enjoy vegetabless, but felt there was an imbalance of noodle to vegetable. I found this a bit odd, since restaurants typically try to overload with carbs rather than the more expensive vegetables. I enjoyed the chicken and the noodles, as I‚Äôm a huuuuuuge ‚Äúthick egg-type‚Äù noodle fan, as opposed to thinner spaghetti-like types. Note that they cook their noodles a little under al-dente, so if you prefer less chewy noodles, just request them to be ‚Äúfully cooked‚Äù.</p>

<p>Yakisoba for the win!</p>
