I"­<p>Eating from Pearl River Deli transports me back to the foods of my childhood. Unlike many other Chinese eateries, the menu only revolves around 20 or so items every week, with a few specials that still frequent the menu list despite their â€œspecialâ€ title. The variety that Chinese restaurants offer can already be overwhelming, yet PRDâ€™s more limited offerings still puts me in a difficult game of making decisions.</p>
