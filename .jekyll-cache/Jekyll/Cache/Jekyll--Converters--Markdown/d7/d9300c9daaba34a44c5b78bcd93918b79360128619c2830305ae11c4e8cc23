<p>Yup, you read that right. Noodles. In virtually every culture, an iconic noodle dish exists â€“ Italian <em>pasta</em>, Japanese <em>udon</em>, Korean <em>japchae</em>, Jewish <em>kugel</em>, Singaporean <em>laksa</em>, Filipino <em>pancit</em> â€“ you get the point. So where did this versatile ingredient / base originate? What was the catalyst for its widespread popularity? How are noodles the foundation to many fusion cuisines? How can plant-based eaters enjoy this dish thatâ€™s typically accompanied by meat? And then Iâ€™m excited to share my dream noodle list.</p>

<p>If you donâ€™t know I love noodles, <em>udon know me</em>. Be prepared for all the noodle puns I could think of (and find online).</p>
