<p>I started to be curious about my grandmaâ€™s kitchen endeavors around 7 years old, and I turned that curiosity into cooking show and culinary YouTube marathons. I cook with my grandma often, but bake with my sister too, which youâ€™ll see more in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>I learned that with every bite of food, thereâ€™s a story that comes with it. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, itâ€™s very likely that youâ€™ve shared similar food experiences. With cooking comes diverse stories, and living in America has allowed me to experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places.</p>

<h3 id="see-some-of-the-stories-behind-my-favorite-foods-here"><a href="/stories/favoritefoods" class="nounderline">See some of the stories behind my favorite foods here.</a></h3>

<p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be releasing interviews with food establishment owners, recipes for anyone to follow, and stories attached to my favorite eats. I hope @CarissaEats can allow my viewers to enjoy food alongside me; it really is something Iâ€™m incredibly grateful to have every day.</p>

<p>My <strong><a href="/beyond.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">beyond page</a></strong> will share some destinations Iâ€™ve been blessed to explore (with food as the highlight), whether itâ€™s eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or shakshuka in Israel.</p>

<p><em>Photos on this blog are taken by me. My portraits are taken by Antonia, but Iâ€™ll include her food photography from time-to-time</em></p>
