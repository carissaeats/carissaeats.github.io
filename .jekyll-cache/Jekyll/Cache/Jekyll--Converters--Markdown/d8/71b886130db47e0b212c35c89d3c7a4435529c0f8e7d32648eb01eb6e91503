<p>Serving up everything from teri buns to Korean-style ramen to mixed tempura, <a href="http://misoteriyaki.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Miso Teriyaki</a> entered the Bergen County dining scene in March 2020. When I saw a teriyaki restaurant coming to Tenafly, it dawned on me that I havenâ€™t had teriyaki in years. Apparently, itâ€™s the unofficial signature dish of Seattle, which now makes me regret not eating it when I had the opportunity to go there.</p>

<p>But alas, Miso arrived and according to their logo, theyâ€™re based in Seattle! I donâ€™t know their full story, but I would love to interview them and get the full scoop on their roots and why they decided to bring the West Coast over to <em>cold Jersey</em>.</p>

<p>Above, you can see their hand trimmed, char-broiled <strong>beef teriyaki</strong>, which from some angles, kind of just looks like cooked beef. But wow, it packs a punch! If you enjoy beef bulgogi, you may equally enjoy this. The classic â€œburntâ€ flavor is present, but not in an overwhelming way that turns you off â€“ if youâ€™ve ever had East Asian barbecue, you know the sensation! You can tell the marinade is deeply embedded throughout the beef and isnâ€™t just added in the last few minutes of cooking. Seriously enjoyed this dish!</p>

<p>I believe all the teriyaki dishes come with a small container of their teriyaki sauce, but I personally prefer the meat or â€œsubstanceâ€ (tofu, shrimp, salmon, etc.) of the dish by itself. Save that little sauce vessel for the huge side dishes of rice on them.</p>

<p>Okay, vegetable galore in this noodle dish. The amount of veggies in their <strong>chicken yakisoba</strong> would be my criticism, but not for a dislike of veggies!! I enjoy vegetabless, but felt there was an imbalance of noodle to vegetable. I found this a bit odd, since restaurants typically try to overload with carbs rather than the more expensive vegetables. I enjoyed the chicken and the noodles, as Iâ€™m a huuuuuuge â€œthick egg-typeâ€ noodle fan, as opposed to thinner spaghetti-like types. Note that they cook their noodles a little under al-dente, so if you prefer less chewy noodles, just request them to be â€œfully cookedâ€.</p>

<p>Yakisoba for the win!</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know why, but <strong>chicken katsu</strong> always hits the spot for me. Itâ€™s some part of a chicken covered in panko breadcrumbs, BUT OH MY I just love it. Miso serves a katsu sauce thatâ€™s not the traditional <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bull-Dog-Vegetable-Fruit-Tonkatsu-Bottles/dp/B01N5DB4EW" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Bull-Dog Tonkatsu Sauce</a>. I wasnâ€™t able to catch a photo of the sauce, but dare I say, it was better than the Bull-Dog? I may just be making that up â€“ they could very well be the same. Anyway, Misoâ€™s katsu was thinner than I liked, but thatâ€™s simply a preference. The katsu is a great pairing to an assortment of otherwise grilled meats.</p>

<p>Finally, to the right of the chicken katsu is the <strong>rib teriyaki</strong>. Itâ€™s the winner of these four dishes today! The ribs are laterally cut â€“ the same way Korean galbi ribs* are.</p>

<p>Operating during the pandemic is already a huge challenge, but opening at the beginning of one adds its own obstacles to an already difficult time. I know Miso isnâ€™t alone in this struggle, but if you have the means to support another business right now, keep Miso on your list!</p>
