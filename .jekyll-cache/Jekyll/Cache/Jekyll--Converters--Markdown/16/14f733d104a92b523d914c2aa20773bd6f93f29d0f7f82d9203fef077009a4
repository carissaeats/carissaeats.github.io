<p>Meet the restaurant that made me realize how good the Cantonese food could be in Orlando.</p>

<p>And since my first time eating here, Iâ€™ve been nothing short of impressed by the Cantonese restaurants in this city.</p>

<p>If you walk into a Chinese restaurant and â€œseafoodâ€ is part of its name, you can expect it to serve Cantonese cuisine specifically.</p>
