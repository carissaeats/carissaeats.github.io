<p>If you know me, you know I am a Trojan Farmers Market pad Thai fan first, human second!</p>

<p>You can order it with or without the chicken pictured, and it’s absolutely delicious either way. A full plate of pad Thai is $8, while a pad Thai + chicken runs at $13. The first time I had it, I could tell it had been sitting out for a while…yet it still tasted fantastic. The next few times, it came out looking as smooth and soft as it looks pictured here. If you like peanuts, I highly suggest eating the chicken with the peanut sauce they provide. The chicken is already so flavorful, but the peanut sauce balances it out by adding a dimension of sweetness.</p>

<p>Their Thai tea is also great! At $5, it is a bit on the pricier side, but on a 100° Wednesday, I never regret getting it if I can!</p>

<p>These pupusas run at $4 apiece, regardless of the filling inside. I’ve tried the pupusas con pollo, vegetales, y queso (chicken, vegetables, &amp; cheese), as well as the pupusas con carne asada y queso (steak &amp; cheese). They are served with a side of curtido, a Salvadoran fermented cabbage, carrot, onion, and hot pepper slaw, as well as crema Salvadoreña if you’d like. Crispy, cheesy, and filling, pupusas make me feel so happy.</p>
