<p>From Los Angeles to the Caribbean, chef Rashida Holmes pays homage to her Afro-Caribbean roots with this Bajan and Trinidadian family-run spot. I was immediately greeted with a mural of exactly who they are and what they stand for: joy, flavor, love, heritage, innovation, and community. No restaurant has to share their values, but Bridgetown Rotiâ€™s effort to share theirs set me up with the calm energy I needed for the feast I was about to enjoy.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon Bridgetown Roti back in September 2022, when the concept was just a pop-up achieving their dreams and accomplishing even more. Appearing as a local celebrity chef at the USC Annenberg 50th Anniversary evening celebration, Rashida served up small plates of green curry head-on shrimp cucumber chutney roti chips, curried yam and mango mini patties, and pineapple upside-down cake.</p>

<p>Perhaps I ate this plate a little too long ago to have a solid review of it, but I will say this much â€“ after eating Rashidaâ€™s food that day, I have been a loyal follower, previously mapping out a multiple bus route to their former residence in the shared space, Crafted Kitchen, and staying posted for updates on the brick-and-mortar Rashida dreamed of opening.</p>

<p>**<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9d4WskvECr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">official flight on July 20th, 2024</a></p>

<p>And this dream took official flight on July 20th, 2024! Big day for Bridgetown Roti fans. So on my first visit just a week ago, I was the first customer of the day! Truthfully, I do love me some takeout, but I figured it was worthwhile to stay in the environment I had waited so long to enjoy her food in. Lined with vibrant decorative Bahama shutters and a massive patty warmer, Bridgetown Roti convinces you to stay without even asking. After all, the establishment is set up as a counter-serve, so its purpose is more of a good time rather than a long time. But once the beautifully arranged tray of food arrived, I sat peacefully in my decision to stay.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s have a look at the menu!</p>
