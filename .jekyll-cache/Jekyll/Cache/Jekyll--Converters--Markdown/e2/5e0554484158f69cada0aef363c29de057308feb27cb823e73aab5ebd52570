<p>It’s hard to say I’m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian-American. I’m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because I’m of Chinese descent, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian – I “look” Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian-American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>There’s no look to being Asian-American (and that goes for various racial groups)! Yes, there are discussions to be had regarding colorism and being white-presenting/-assuming. But for those who proudly identify as Asian-American, it’s dehumanizing to hear that you don’t look Asian or to get the “no way you’re Asian” response. It’s stripping away a piece of someone’s identity.</p>

<p>Asia is a vast geographic region and is <em>roughly</em> divided into five sub-regions: Western Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia. Some people of Asian descent may not individually identify as Asian – plus, nobody should be forced into a box, even though we’re often required to put ourselves in them . But the point is, the Asian-American identity encompasses a wide range of ethnicities and cultures, so let’s not be too quick to disrespect someone.</p>

<p>I can only speak for my experience as an East Asian, and most specifically, a Chinese-American. I’ll link additional Asian-American identity pieces at the very bottom, where you can explore the beautiful tapestry of Asian cultures and ethnoreligions.</p>

<h4 id="food-is">Food is…</h4>

<p>Emotional. Powerful. Uniting.</p>

<p>What’s the first food that pops into your head when you hear, “American food”? Burgers? Grilled cheese? Mac and cheese?</p>

<p>Why is General Tso Chicken not on that list?</p>

<p>Why are BIPOC folx only allowed to be experts in foods of their heritage? That’s not to discredit any white chefs. Good food is good food. It’s just frustrating when chefs of color don’t garner <em>nearly</em> the same amount of awards.</p>

<p>Why are white Americans allowed to venture into any international cuisine, but Chinese Americans only allowed to cook egg rolls?</p>

<p>And people might be surprised to find out that most Chinese food isn’t heavy or even deep-fried.</p>

<p>People will participate in Cinco de Mayo happy hours, wear racially insensitive costumes, and say they love tacos – but support ICE (<a href="https://abolish-ice.carrd.co/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Abolish ICE.</a>) and endorse Trump’s abhorrent labelling of Mexicans as criminals and drug lords. The most of Mexican culture people will even <em>tolerate</em> is tacos and tequila.</p>
