<p>Being Chinese-American is a part of my identity that Iâ€™m learning to embrace more and more every day. While I was born in New Jersey, both my parents immigrated to America from China (Guangdong Province). Heck, even my sister was born in Canada, so <em>technically</em>, Iâ€™m the first American-born Chinese in my family!</p>
