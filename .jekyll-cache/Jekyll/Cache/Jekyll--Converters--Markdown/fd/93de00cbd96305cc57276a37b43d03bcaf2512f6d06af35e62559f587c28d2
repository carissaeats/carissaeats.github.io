<p>With Thanksgiving tomorrow, I wanted to say what the annual Turkey Day means to me, recap how I celebrated for the past few years (and say what I’m doing this year), and share some Thanksgiving recipes from my favorite food bloggers.</p>

<p>So what does Thanksgiving mean to me?</p>

<p>In elementary and part of middle school, the Chinese community in my town would frequently have get-togethers (we used to hang out a lot!), and I would always look forward to the main event of the year: Thanksgiving dinner! Most, if not all of us (my town’s Chinese community), don’t have any extended family in the states, so our communal heritage brought us even closer as friends. As the years passed, though, we’ve lowered it on our priorities list. Quarantine makes me feel even more nostalgic about those times, but I remain hopeful about seeing them in the future.</p>

<p>But anyway…in the past few years, I’ve felt the magic of this four-day weekend fizzle out, but my appreciation for this four-day weekend . It not only gives me some time to unwind from the hecticness of school, but also to share my gratitude for people who’ve made a remarkable impact in my life in the past 11 months.</p>

<p>In 2016, my dad, Antonia, and I took our first trip in quite some time after we had a big event in our life happen earlier in the year. On Thanksgiving Day 2016, we headed to <a href="https://www.bonedaddies.com/restaurant/shackfuyu/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Shack-Fuyu: The Japanese Restaurant by Bone Daddies</a>. I kid you not, returning to this place is on my bucket list. Shack-Fuyu is the type of sit-down restaurant I’m most into - the modern spin on East Asian food with signature dishes and desserts.</p>
