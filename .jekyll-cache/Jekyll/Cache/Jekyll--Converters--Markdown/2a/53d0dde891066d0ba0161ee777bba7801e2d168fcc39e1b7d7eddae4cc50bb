I"Õ<p>I visited my sister in LA in 2018 (I wrote a recap here), and I always say it was one of the happiest weekends of my life. While I donâ€™t expect every day to exactly mirror that weekend, it just makes me optimistic about my future there ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>I have no clue where the next few years will take me, but I do know what I want to prioritize in the future:</p>

<p>Highlighting the stories behind foods
Learning the history behind a variety of cuisines
Expanding my palate
Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be
Connecting with small businesses
Empathizing with more diverse groups of people
Canâ€™t wait to see you soon, LA!</p>
