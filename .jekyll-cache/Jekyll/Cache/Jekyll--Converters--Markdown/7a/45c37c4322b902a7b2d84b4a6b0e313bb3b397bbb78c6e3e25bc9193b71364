        Bei Fung Tong Seafood

<p>Meet the restaurant that made me realize how good the Cantonese food could be in Orlando.</p>

<p>And since my first time eating here, I’ve been nothing short of impressed by the Cantonese restaurants in this city.</p>

<p>If you walk into a Chinese restaurant and “seafood” is part of its name, you can expect it to serve Cantonese cuisine specifically. This is likely because Guangzhou (also known as Canton) is located along the South China Sea, along with other cities in the Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. This prime location by the sea means the seafood in this region is always excellent, fresh, and pretty plentiful. Cantonese food is one of the most well-known Chinese cuisines in America — <em>dim sum</em> is most associated with Cantonese cuisine. Many of these seafood restaurants do dim sum services, whether it’s by ordering from a menu or waving down the people who push the iconic dim sum carts.</p>

<p>During fall 2021, I would say my family went here once or twice a week. It’s not uncommon for Cantonese people to go to dim sum daily. People go with two or three friends, and they split a pot of <em>cha</em> and two or three dim sum dishes. Dim sum is designed to be shared — a steamer of <em>siumaai</em> may come with three pieces, for example. People may do this as an morning or afternoon snack, making dim sum an easy, delicious excuse to see friends! Whenever we went to Ten Ten, we often saw some of the same people with the same trusty two or three steamers of dim sum.</p>

<p>Ten Ten offers the beloved push cart service, so you’re never at a shortage of quick decisions needing to made when you’re here. They not only offer basically every dim sum dish you’d want, but they also do it excellently. Might I make a case for the best egg tarts in Orlando, potentially in all of America? Continue scrolling to see what’s up 👀 However, like all dim sum restaurants, you can participate in picking dishes from the carts and/or order something to be prepared <em>a la carte</em>.</p>

<p>Let’s get to it!</p>

<p>Yes…the best egg tarts I’ve <em>ever</em> had. Yes, they’re in Orlando, Florida. Please hold the chuckles, but I’m being honest when I say some of the best food I’ve had in my life has been in Orlando. Perhaps it’s recency bias or even the fact that I’m older and know my taste buds better now, but nonetheless, I absolutely adore the Orlando food scene.</p>

<p>These egg tarts deserve each of these four photos. I also included them because you can tell these are made in-house, because each time I go, they look different! People may say it’s inconsistent quality because of that, but they never fail to deliver on excellent puffy, flaky crust and a perfect custard. Absolute exquisite. 🤌</p>

<p>Well, that’s not quite the title they put for these dishes, but when I say there’s no other preparations of seafood I love more than these two, I mean it!</p>

<p>Also known as beef chow fun, this dish is a popular Cantonese dish that consists of wok-tossed rice noodles soy sauce, thin steak, mung bean sprouts, onions, and scallions. It’s so simple, but requires years of technique perfecting, according to my dad. This is because chefs need to develop the <em>wok hei</em>, or the wok’s breath/air. This <a href="https://guide.michelin.com/en/article/dining-out/what-is-wok-hei" target="_blank" class="nounderline">article on the Michelin Guide</a> explains it quite well. To achieve <em>wok hei</em>, chefs must have intense heat and lots of stamina, because the food needs to be constantly tossed. While many professional chefs have little to no arm and hair, my dad always says Cantonese chefs are especially prone to this, because they constantly have their wrists/hands near the flames. Anyway, I digress. The <em>wok hei</em> produces a unique smoky, often caramelized savory taste . I’m hungry just thinking about all the dishes with <em>wok hei</em>.</p>

<p>Ten Ten makes a great chow fun, and I can’t wait to go back home and eat it. For fellow cooked onion/scallion lovers, you will be satisfied!</p>

Wet-style, or <em>sup chow</em>, means the noodles and vegetables are all stir-fried without sauce, but are  topped with a soupier, thicker sauce upon serving.</h6>
