<p>Meet the restaurant that made me realize how good the Cantonese food could be in Orlando.</p>

<p>And since my first time eating here, I‚Äôve been nothing short of impressed by the Cantonese restaurants in this city.</p>

<p>If you walk into a Chinese restaurant and ‚Äúseafood‚Äù is part of its name, you can expect it to serve Cantonese cuisine specifically. This is likely because Guangzhou (also known as Canton) is located along the South China Sea, along with other cities in the Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. This prime location by the sea means the seafood in this region is always excellent, fresh, and pretty plentiful. Cantonese food is one of the most well-known Chinese cuisines in America ‚Äî <em>dim sum</em> is most associated with Cantonese cuisine. Many of these seafood restaurants do dim sum services, whether it‚Äôs by ordering from a menu or waving down the people who push the iconic dim sum carts.</p>

<p>During fall 2021, I would say my family went here once or twice a week. It‚Äôs not uncommon for Cantonese people to go to dim sum daily. People go with two or three friends, and they split a pot of <em>cha</em> and two or three dim sum dishes. Dim sum is designed to be shared ‚Äî a steamer of <em>siumaai</em> may come with three pieces, for example. People may do this as an morning or afternoon snack, making dim sum an easy, delicious excuse to see friends! Whenever we went to Ten Ten, we often saw some of the same people with the same trusty two or three steamers of dim sum.</p>

<p>Ten Ten offers the beloved push cart service, so you‚Äôre never at a shortage of quick decisions needing to made when you‚Äôre here. They not only offer basically every dim sum dish you‚Äôd want, but they also do it excellently. Might I make a case for the best egg tarts in Orlando, potentially in all of America? Continue scrolling to see what‚Äôs up However, like all dim sum restaurants, you can participate in picking dishes from the carts and/or order something to be prepared <em>a la carte</em>.</p>
