<p>Itâ€™s hard to say Iâ€™m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian American. Iâ€™m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because I am East Asian, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian â€“ I â€œlookâ€ Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no look to being Asian American (and that goes for various racial groups)! Yes, there are discussions to be had regarding colorism and being white-presenting/-assuming. But for those who proudly identify as Asian American, itâ€™s dehumanizing to hear that you donâ€™t look Asian or to get the â€œno way youâ€™re Asianâ€ response. Itâ€™s stripping away a piece of someoneâ€™s identity.</p>

<p>Asia is a vast geographic region and is <em>roughly</em> divided into five sub-regions: West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia. Some people of Asian descent may not individually identify as Asian â€“ plus, nobody should be forced into a box, even though weâ€™re often required to put ourselves in one. But the point is, the Asian American identity encompasses a wide range of ethnicities and cultures, so letâ€™s not be too quick to disrespect someone.</p>

<p>I can only speak for my experience as an East Asian, and most specifically, a Chinese-American. Iâ€™ll link additional Asian American identity pieces at the very bottom, where you can explore the beautiful tapestry of Asian cultures and ethnoreligions.</p>

<h4 id="food-is">Food isâ€¦</h4>

<p>Emotional. Powerful. Uniting.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the first food that pops into your head when you hear, â€œAmerican foodâ€? Burgers? Grilled cheese? Mac and cheese?</p>

<p>My elementary school encouraged me to view America as a melting pot. <em>America as a melting pot is a myth</em> (for now). Yes, itâ€™s true that immigrants have brought pieces of their culture to the U.S., but their contributions, particularly those of non-white immigrants, are severely undervalued and exploited.</p>

<p>Why is sesame chicken not on that list of American foods? If America really treasured the tapestry of ethnicities present, we would recognize dishes like sesame chicken as a Chinese-<strong>American</strong>, rather than Chinese. The dish is â€œforeign foodâ€ to most Chinese residents and was created to cater to the white palate.</p>

<p>I may be of Chinese heritage, but Iâ€™ll never have the same experience as someone who was born/raised and currently resides in China. Iâ€™ll never even have the same experience as my dad, who would be considered a first-generation Chinese-American immigrant. My sister and I are the first in our family to be born outside of China,</p>

<p>Sesame chicken is a dish I hate to love. I wonâ€™t deny anyone of the dishâ€™s tastiness, but I feel frustrated by white people who feel entitled to Chinese heritage/culture just because they bought the $9 combo plate at Good Taste. <strong>Chinese food is more than sesame chicken.</strong></p>

<p>And Chinese food itself is incredibly diverse. My paternal side hails from the Guangdong (Canton) province of southern China, while my maternal side lives mostly in Hong Kong. <em>Yum cha</em> (translation: drink tea), or dim sum (as itâ€™s more popularly known), hails from these two regions, so my family enjoyed many dim sum outings in Flushing, Queens and Manhattan, Chinatown frequently, prior to the start of the pandemic. But the sheer size of Mainland China means the climate, resources, and people vary per province. Thus, every region has its culinary specialties and flavors ranging from mala (â€œnumbing-spicyâ€) to barbecue.</p>

<p>People might be surprised to find out that most Chinese food isnâ€™t heavy or even deep-fried.</p>

<p>For example, white people will participate in Cinco de Mayo happy hours, wear racially insensitive costumes, and say they love tacos â€“ but theyâ€™ll support ICE (<a href="https://abolish-ice.carrd.co/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Abolish ICE.</a>) and endorse Trumpâ€™s racist, derogatory statements about Mexican people. Tacos and tequila are are the most of Mexican culture theyâ€™ll even <em>tolerate</em>.</p>

<p>Why are white Americans allowed to venture into any international cuisine, but Chinese Americans only allowed to cook egg rolls? Why are BIPOC folx only allowed to be experts in foods of their heritage?</p>

<p>This is not to discredit any white chefs. Good food is good food. Itâ€™s just frustrating when chefs of color donâ€™t garner <em>nearly</em> the same amount of awards. For example, there are Black and Asian French people who are French cuisine connoisseurs, yet the â€œFrench culinary greatsâ€ are all white (look up â€œbest French chefâ€ on Google). Whereâ€™s the proper recognition for BIPOC chefs?</p>

<h4 id="i-wont-be-a-movie-stereotype">I wonâ€™t be a movie stereotype.</h4>

<p>Why are white people with French or Italian accents fawned over, but any BIPOC individual with an accent is immediately othered and deemed foreign, oriental (ğŸ™„), or weird? If I had to think of a reason why, Iâ€™d attribute the double standard to television and movie depictions. Thereâ€™s the French lover and Fabio movie tropes, but BIPOC are characters used as an obstacle to the â€œtrue love storyâ€ or reduced to racist stereotypes.</p>

<h4 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h4>

<p>To the white people who go to my high school â€“ one with a predominantly East and South Asian student body â€“ you are not â€œbasically Asianâ€. You can love the food, but you do not get to claim the most palatable forms of Asian-ness only when itâ€™s most convenient for you.</p>

<p>Please donâ€™t put the burden of anti-Asian racism on other BIPOC. We cannot ignore anti-Blackness and how our community perpetuates it. And even within the Asian diaspora, ethnic groups have complicated, painful histories between one another. Absolutely continue having conversations and pushing others to fight against all types of racism. Take legitimate action. But white people should be the first to speak on anti-Asian racism â€“ when Asian people speak on it, some white people donâ€™t hear it.</p>
