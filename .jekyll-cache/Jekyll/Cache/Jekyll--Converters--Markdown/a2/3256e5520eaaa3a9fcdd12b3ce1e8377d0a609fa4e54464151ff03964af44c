<p>I started to be curious about my grandma’s kitchen endeavors around 7 years old, and I turned that curiosity into cooking show (and eventually, culinary YouTube) marathons. I cook with my grandma often, but bake with my sister too, which you’ll see more in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>I learned that with every bite of food, there’s a story that comes with it. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, it’s very likely that you guys have had some similar food experiences. With cooking comes diverse stories, and living in America has allowed me to experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places</p>

<h3 id="see-some-of-the-stories-behind-my-favorite-foods-here"><a href="/stories/favoritefoods" class="nounderline">See some of the stories behind my favorite foods here.</a></h3>

<p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>

<p>I’ll be releasing interviews with food establishment owners, recipes for anyone to follow, and stories attached to my favorite eats. Food is something I’m incredibly grateful to be able to enjoy every day, and I hope my viewers can enjoy alongside me.</p>

<p>My <strong><a href="/beyond.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">beyond</a></strong> page will share some destinations (with food as the highlight) I’ve been blessed to explore, whether it’s eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or shakshuka in Israel.</p>
