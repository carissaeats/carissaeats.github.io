<p>Hey everyone! So Iâ€™ve been pretty MIA on here and on Instagram, so I just wanted to keep you all updated on where Iâ€™ve been.</p>

<p>I know I donâ€™t have a huge audience, so this â€œlife updateâ€ might not even be necessary! But I do have a lot on my mind, regarding where Iâ€™m at and what I want to do, so bear with me while I explain.</p>

<p>First big thing: Iâ€™m moving. Iâ€™ll be going to college next year, but my dad is also moving! Iâ€™ve lived in [redacted town, out of an abundance of caution] my entire life, and itâ€™s rather bittersweet to move. On one hand, Iâ€™ve always felt safe living in my house, which has been a huge privilege to have. This town is the only place Iâ€™ve ever known as â€œhomeâ€, which is a true luxury that many people yearn for. While my sister and I took our daily walk the other day, I began reminiscing on all of the staples in my town: the multitude of pizza shops, the (now-closed) cookware store, the diner, among many others.</p>

<p>And then, thereâ€™s the â€œsweetâ€ part of moving: I would love a fresh start. My family was actually supposed to move three years ago, but those plans fell through. My family went through a big loss nearly five years ago, and the house sometimes feels like a never-ending reminder of that loss and all events leading up to it. Plus, the opportunity to have a fresh start feels more appealing than ever, since the last year has felt very stagnant due to the pandemic â€“ which is absolutely not a terrible thing â€“ but to have the ability to move by choice excites me.</p>
