<p><strong><a href="https://katsuneusa.business.site/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Katsune Donkatsu Café</a></strong> is a modest counter-serve café setting decorated only by picnic-patterned tables. Katsu is a popular Japanese/Korean deep fried panko breaded meat cutlet served with “Bull Dog” tonkatsu sauce, a Japanese sauce sweetened with fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>Katsune is one of the few Bergen County restaurants totally dedicated to katsu-style dishes, and they’ve mastered it. The restaurant has lengthier and flatter panko breadcrumbs that make their katsu flakier than all.</p>

<p>The café serves up the standard pork donkatsu, as well as the famous <strong>cheese “Cordon Bleu” donkatsu</strong> (pork - <em>pictured below</em>), chicken, ebi (shrimp), beef and pork patty (menchi) katsu dishes. They also serve up a “Wang Donkatsu”, a much larger, even crispier, pounded flat donkatsu. A side of made-in-house curry can be added to all dishes too.</p>

<p>Their cheese donkatsu comes with a generous stuffing of mozzarella cheese that makes for the picture-perfect cheese pull. Katsune also keeps their pork tenderloin so juicy after frying, something that’s difficult to accomplish in deep-fried meat dishes.</p>

<p>All dishes are served with a side of steamed white rice, corn, Japanese-style coleslaw, and soy sauce pickles. They are also accompanied by the standard “Bull Dog” tonkatsu sauce, as well as a homemade banana sauce that’s surprisingly addictive.</p>

<p>The unassuming exterior of the restaurant might not bring you in right away, but the flakiest katsu in Bergen County (maybe even in the NYC area…) makes this a place you’ll regret not eating at. Katsune Donkatsu for the win!</p>
