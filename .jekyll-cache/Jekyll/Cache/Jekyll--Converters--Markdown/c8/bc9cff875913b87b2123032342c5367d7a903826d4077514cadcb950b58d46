<p>Being Chinese-American is a part of my identity that Iâ€™m learning to embrace more and more every day. While I was born in New Jersey, both my parents immigrated to America from China (Guangdong Province). Heck, even my sister was born in Canada, so <em>technically</em>, Iâ€™m the first American-born Chinese in my family, even if my sister has pretty much lived in the states her whole life. But yeah, I love being Chinese, although I havenâ€™t always embraced that. I want to be as specific as possible when discussing this piece of my identity, as although I am Asian-American, I canâ€™t speak on behalf of people of other Asian ethnic groups, and I know that Asian-American isnâ€™t always the most inclusive term. This is also just my personal experience that Iâ€™ve been really wanting to talk about for a while, but maybe some people can relate.</p>

<p>As a young-ing, I went to Mandarin language school for a few years. Unfortunately, I never picked it up. Since itâ€™s typically easier to learn languages as a kid, students with parents who spoke Mandarin around them could absorb the newer material at Mandarin school. My parents spoke Cantonese around me, which is another widespread Chinese dialect, although itâ€™s popularity may be waning a bit. Even then, Iâ€™m still not fluent in Cantonese, but I would consider myself conversational. My grandma has been â€œpermanentlyâ€ living with me since 2014 (I think), so she definitely helps me practice my Cantonese. I would love to pick up Mandarin in the near future, so I hope to dedicate my next summer to learning Mandarin.</p>

<p>The language has been a major point of contention in my journey as a Chinese-American. People in my life have made me feel less Chinese than them since I donâ€™t speak Mandarin, and Iâ€™m pretty positive the parents in my townâ€™s Chinese community donâ€™t love that about me. Does speaking the â€œmother tongueâ€ make someone Chinese? Iâ€™m not sure, but I feel ashamed about it sometimes. It feels like a competition with other Chinese-Americans to be the â€œmost Chineseâ€, but Iâ€™m starting to realize (as cheesy at it sounds) that itâ€™s not a competition with others, itâ€™s about improving myself from the day before.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to talk about is the food. This blog is a website focused on food and culture, and</p>
