I"õ	<p>Hey! My name is Carissa Liu (She/Her/Hers), a Jersey girl who‚Äôs now calling Los Angeles and Orlando her new homes. Welcome to my food, travel, and personal blog!</p>

But I also love doughnuts, fried seafood, bagel sandwiches, halloumi citrus salads (very specific), Korean corn dogs, banana üçå + strawberry üçì ice cream, and waffles ‚Äî not necessarily all in that order üòã</h6>

    <p>I started being curious about my grandma‚Äôs kitchen endeavors at around 7 years old, and I turned that curiosity into having cooking show and culinary YouTube marathons. I cook with my grandma often, but bake with my sister too. Hopefully I can share more recipes here soon!</p>
    <p>I learned that there‚Äôs a story that accompanies every bite of food. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, it‚Äôs very likely that you've shared similar food experiences. With cooking comes diverse stories, and living in America has allowed me to build bridges between various cultures through the wide variety of food experiences available here.</p>
    <p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>
    <p>I‚Äôll be releasing interviews with food establishment owners, recipes for people of all skill levels to follow, stories attached to my favorite eats, and even foodie TV moments. My writing is super informal, so I hope [@CarissaEats](http://localhost:4000){:class="nounderline"} allows my viewers to casually enjoy food alongside me. T</p>

<p>o have healthy food on the table, let alone a positive relationship with food, is a privilege, and I do, and will, not take that for granted.</p>

<p>Jersey will forever hold a special spot in my heart, but getting to explore the culinary scenes of two new cities and to meet new food enthusiasts is something I‚Äôm incredibly excited about.</p>
