I"|<p>In January â€˜22, Iâ€™ll be heading out west to USC. Living in Los Angeles has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didnâ€™t know this dream would become my reality so soon!</p>

<p>I visited my sister in LA in 2018 (<a href="/beyond/losangeles" class="nounderline">I wrote a recap here</a>), and I always say it was one of the happiest weekends of my life. While I donâ€™t expect every day to exactly mirror that weekend, it just makes me optimistic about my future there ðŸ˜Š</p>

<p>Canâ€™t wait to see you soon, LA!</p>
