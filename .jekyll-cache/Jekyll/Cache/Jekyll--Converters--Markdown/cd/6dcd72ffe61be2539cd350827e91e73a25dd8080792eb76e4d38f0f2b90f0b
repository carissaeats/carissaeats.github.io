<p>With Thanksgiving tomorrow, I wanted to say what the annual Turkey Day means to me, recap how I celebrated for the past few years (and say what I‚Äôm doing this year), and share some Thanksgiving recipes from my favorite food bloggers.</p>

<p>So what does Thanksgiving mean to me?</p>

<p>In elementary and part of middle school, the Chinese community in my town would frequently have get-togethers (we used to hang out a lot!), and I would always look forward to the main event of the year: Thanksgiving dinner! Most, if not all of us (my town‚Äôs Chinese community), don‚Äôt have any extended family in the states, so our communal heritage brought us even closer as friends. As the years passed, though, we‚Äôve lowered it on our priorities list. Quarantine makes me feel even more nostalgic about those times, but I remain hopeful about seeing them in the future.</p>

<p>But anyway‚Ä¶in the past few years, I‚Äôve felt the magic of this four-day weekend fizzle out, but I still feel an immense appreciation for this quick getaway from the hecticness of school. I also spend this time to share my gratitude for people who‚Äôve made a remarkable impact in my life in the past 11 months.</p>

<p>For 2020, I have a lot to be grateful for. Yes, it‚Äôs been a rough year; I‚Äôve had to be on lockdown completely for the past eight months and be <em>almost excessively</em> cautious, because I live with my grandma. It has definitely taken a toll on me, but I‚Äôve had time to reflect on myself about many aspects of my life. This isn‚Äôt my journal, so I don‚Äôt want to delve in too deep, but I still want to share a a short list of the many things I‚Äôve been especially thankful for this year‚Ä¶here it is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I‚Äôve gotten to cultivate a relationship with my dad that wouldn‚Äôt have had the time to be nurtured in other circumstances (and that is <em>not</em> to take away from how this pandemic has impacted millions; COVID-19 to have never happened would be ideal). Have we had our <em>very fair</em> share of quarrels and times we‚Äôve needed to spend apart? Absolutely. But I learned to empathize with him like I had never before, and that‚Äôs just one thing to be thankful for.</li>
  <li>Simply being able to stay at home. My dad‚Äôs been working from home for at least 15 years now, so our family situation was minimally affected.</li>
  <li>This. blog. I have no idea what 2020 would be without this. Even if no one is reading this, I am incredibly lucky to use this platform as a way to share my stories behind food and the businesses I want to share. I‚Äôm not too caught up with the size of my audience, because I do this for myself and my passion for culinary adventures. Building this blog from scratch is my ultimate passion project: there‚Äôs always something to be done, whether it‚Äôs the inner framework, the CSS design, the stories. And I cherish every moment with it.</li>
</ol>

<p>In 2016, my dad, Antonia, and I took our first trip in quite some time after we had a big event in our life happen earlier in the year. On Thanksgiving Day 2016, we headed to <a href="https://www.bonedaddies.com/restaurant/shackfuyu/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Shack-Fuyu: The Japanese Restaurant by Bone Daddies</a>. I kid you not, returning to this place is on my bucket list. Shack-Fuyu is the type of sit-down restaurant I‚Äôm most into - a spin on East Asian food with signature dishes and desserts. This spin doesn‚Äôt need to be a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù take, but needs to have a connection to the chef, in whichever way that may be. This dish is the Iberico Pork Pluma with Spring Onion and Black Pepper Miso. Get the Kinako French Toast with Matcha Soft Serve too. <em>Absolute chef‚Äôs kiss</em>‚Ä¶okay, back to the Thanksgiving stuff. I went off on a tangent.</p>

<p>In 2017, I remember it being a Chinese get together. It‚Äôs only a vague memory, but my dad made a point about this gathering being one of my sister‚Äôs last before heading off to college. In 2018, my dad and I were on a flight to visit Antonia! We flew from the Philly airport (far cheaper than from JFK), so that day was just getting to the airport, waiting, flying, and eating at pretty much the only restaurant still open on Thanksgiving day (a Hong Kong caf√©, IIRC). That weekend remains one of the favorite times in my life thus far. I was ‚Äúhomesick‚Äù for my sister, and it couldn‚Äôt have been a better getaway. Last year, I spent it by eating a BEC from Celebrity Bagels and just watching Netflix. This year will probably be similar: I‚Äôll be eating some good food, taking a break, and hanging with Antonia. And I cannot wait.</p>
