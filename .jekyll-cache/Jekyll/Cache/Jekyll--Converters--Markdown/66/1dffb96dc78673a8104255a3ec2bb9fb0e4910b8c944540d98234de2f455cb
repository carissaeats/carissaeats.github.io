I"Î<p>Iâ€™m honored and excited to finally announce that Iâ€™m a partner for the exclusive launch of IRVINS Salted Egg Salmon Fish Skin chips!</p>

<p>IRVINS Salted Egg chips turned a signature <em>Salted Egg Crab</em> dish, which became a local River Valley phenomenon, into some #DangerouslyAddictive snacks. As they say on their website,</p>
