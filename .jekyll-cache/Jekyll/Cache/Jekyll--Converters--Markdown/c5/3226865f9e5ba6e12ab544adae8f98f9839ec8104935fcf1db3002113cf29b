I"¦<p>Itâ€™s hard to say Iâ€™m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian-American. Iâ€™m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because Iâ€™m of Chinese descent, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian â€“ I â€œlookâ€ Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian-American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no look to being Asian-American! And for those who proudly identify as Asian-American, itâ€™s dehumanizing to hear that you donâ€™t look Asian or to get the â€œno way youâ€™re Asianâ€ response. Itâ€™s stripping away a piece of someoneâ€™s identity.</p>
