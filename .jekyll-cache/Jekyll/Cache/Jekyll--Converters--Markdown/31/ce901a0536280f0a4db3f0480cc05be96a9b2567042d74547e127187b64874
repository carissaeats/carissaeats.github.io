<p><em>Humm</em>-us where the heart is.</p>

<p>I get a little carried away with the puns during recipe posts, so bear with me.</p>

<p>My family had some pantry stuff we wanted to consume right away, so I came up with the idea to make a three-ish piece platter, with homemade pita, eggs in purgatory (kinda), and avocado hummus!</p>

<p>These recipes are by no-means authentic – however, they are inspired by the meals I had in Israel, where the food is very veggie-centric and extraordinarily fresh. Here’s a photo:</p>

<h6 id="-i-dont-know-the-exact-names-of-all-but-theres-couscous-cabbage-slaw-and-tomato-red-onion-salad">* I don’t know the exact names of all, but there’s couscous, cabbage slaw, and tomato-red onion salad.</h6>

<p>Okay, so maybe I didn’t hit the mark exactly, but I tried. The first recipe will be <strong>eggs in purgatory</strong>, akin to the North African <em>shakshuka</em>. Eggs in purgatory is called Uova in Purgatorio, but <a href="https://www.savoringitaly.com/eggs-in-purgatory-uova-in-purgatorio/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">the name may vary depending on the region of Italy</a>. The eggs are “souls” seeking purification in the red-hot tomato sauce of purgatory. I struggled to find a formal history on this dish on the internet. However, shakshuka maintains a richer internet presence.</p>

<h4 id="avocado-hummus">Avocado Hummus:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2 medium sized avocados</li>
  <li>15-oz can chickpeas, drained**</li>
  <li>½ lemon (or ¾ tbsp vinegar)</li>
  <li>garlic oil <strong>with the garlic intact</strong>: reserve 2-3 garlic cloves and 3 tbsp of oil ***</li>
  <li>salt + pepper to taste</li>
  <li>aquafaba, only as needed</li>
</ul>

<p>** DO NOT drain the liquid down the sink! It’s aquafaba, so pour it into a bowl – use aquafaba in <a href="https://tasty.co/article/whitneyjefferson/aquafaba-the-magic-bean-liquid" class="nounderline" target="_blank">recipes like these</a></p>

<p>*** To make garlic oil: Cook 2-3 heads of garlic in 1 cup of oil on low for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dump all ingredients except the avocados in a food processor or blender. Blend for about 2 minutes, until all the chickpeas are completely broken down.</li>
  <li>Add avocados to the mixture, and blend until creamy. It should take no more than 2 minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer to a bowl and serve immediately. If you do not plan on serving immediately, transfer and cover it in an airtight container. Squeezing lemon over it will preserve its green hue, but the hummus is still edible even if it darkens.</li>
</ol>
