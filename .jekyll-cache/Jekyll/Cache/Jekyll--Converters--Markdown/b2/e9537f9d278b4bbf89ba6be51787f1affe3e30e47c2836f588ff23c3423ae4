<p>Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pinklady Cheese Tart</a></strong> is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.</p>

<p>When I was in Taiwan, I got to try a boba-filled cheese tart - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. But also the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese that really shined through. Since then, I’ve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me. When I saw <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmiUUdHTPM/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">this post</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeaniuseats/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">@jeaniuseats</a>, I was ECSTATIC!! The location of Pinklady was perfect, as my dad and I stop by Mott Street almost monthly, so I made it a target stop on our next trip.</p>

<p>Pinklady may not be the first cheese tart in Manhattan, but they are one of the only businesses really specializing in cheese tarts. They only sell two products, one being their array of tarts, and the other being their housemade rice yogurt drinks, which I’ve heard lovely things about too.</p>

<p>The store’s giant yellow sign sticks out like a sore thumb on Chinatown’s “unofficial Main Street” that’s packed with the lucky Chinese color of red. There’s no seating inside, which I wouldn’t expect to change after the pandemic, given the store’s small space. There’s a few back-of-the-house staff, but it’s been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times I’ve been there.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, which is not always an easy find at food establishments.</p>

<p>Well anyways, you’ll see that there are “sneeze guard” dividers to protect the tarts from any customers (who must wear a mask inside too), and the tarts are lined up on Silpats and plastic trays. They currently offer five flavors of <strong>original cheese</strong>, <strong>matcha</strong>, <strong>ube</strong> (purple yam), <strong>chocolate</strong>, and <strong>strawberry-filled chocolate</strong>.</p>

<p>Opening at the peak of the pandemic in April is difficul</p>
