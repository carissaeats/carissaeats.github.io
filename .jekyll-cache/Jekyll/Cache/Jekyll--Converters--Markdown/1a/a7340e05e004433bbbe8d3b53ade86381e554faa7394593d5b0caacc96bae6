<p><strong><a href="https://mamieatery.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Ma MÃ¬ Eatery</a></strong> is a fast-casual Vietnamese eatery in Closter, and also the sister restaurant to the popular <strong><a href="http://simplyvietnamese.info/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Simply Vietnamese</a></strong> in Tenafly!</p>

<p>Ma MÃ¬ serves dishes like pho, banh mi, summer rolls, pad Thai, fried rice, salads, and bao buns. As a counter service restaurant, the service is quick, but the food is still made to order and always fresh!</p>

<p>My favorite Ma MÃ¬ dish is the <strong>original grilled pork banh mi</strong>. If youâ€™ve never had banh mi, itâ€™s a Vietnamese baguette thatâ€™s split open and filled to the brim with whatever ingredients your heart desired. Common to a typical banh mi, Ma MÃ¬â€™s OG sandwich is stuffed with juicy grilled pork, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeÃ±o, and creamy aioli. Other common ingredients to this sandwich are patÃ© and Maggi seasoning sauce.</p>

<p>While Iâ€™ll always stand by the original banh mi as my favorite, their <strong>pad Thai dumplings</strong> really set them apart from other places. These fried pockets of pad Thai wrapped with wonton skin burst with flavor, especially when combined with their sweet + sour Nuoc Mam sauce!</p>

<p>If youâ€™re not feeling the extra crunch, they also make an incredible <strong>pad Thai</strong> that might not be traditional, but has a unique sweet and tangy taste. They make their pad Thai with thin rice noodles instead of the flat and wide noodles you might be used to seeing.</p>

<p>One more item Iâ€™d like to share is the <strong>50/50 Jasmine green tea and iced tea</strong> from their â€œsecret menuâ€. With mild notes of green tea and a slightly sour, but still sweet enough, lemon flavor, this drink is especially perfect to cool down on a hot day! If youâ€™re not a fan, they also serve a classic Thai Iced Tea thatâ€™s a little more sweet, but great any time of the year.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve tried A LOT of foods from Ma MÃ¬, and I can say with confidence that Iâ€™ve never had something I didnâ€™t enjoy. If youâ€™re in the area, be sure to put it on your list! Itâ€™s in the perfect location, being only 2 minutes away from Closter Plaza, where you can shop away and finish off with some dessert! What I love about Ma MÃ¬ is the modern take on Vietnamese food that is a great introduction for those who are new to it. They do it so well too!</p>
