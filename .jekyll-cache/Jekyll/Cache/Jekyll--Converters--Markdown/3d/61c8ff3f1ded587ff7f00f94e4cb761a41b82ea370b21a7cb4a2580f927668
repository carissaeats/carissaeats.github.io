<p>Serving up everything from teri buns to Korean-style ramen to mixed tempura, <a href="http://misoteriyaki.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Miso Teriyaki</a> entered the Bergen County dining scene in March 2020. When I saw a teriyaki restaurant coming to Tenafly, it dawned on me that I haven’t had teriyaki in years. Apparently, it’s the unofficial signature dish of Seattle, which now makes me regret not eating it when I had the opportunity to go there.</p>

<p>But alas, Miso arrived and according to their logo, they’re based in Seattle! I don’t know their full story, but I would love to interview them and get the full scoop on their roots and why they decided to bring the West Coast over to <em>cold Jersey</em>.</p>

<p>Above, you can see their hand trimmed, char-broiled beef teriyaki, which from some angles, kind of just looks like cooked beef. But wow, it packs a punch! If you enjoy beef bulgogi, you may equally enjoy this. The classic “burnt” flavor is present, but not in an overwhelming way that turns you off – if you’ve ever had East Asian barbecue, you know the sensation! You can tell the marinade is deeply embedded throughout the beef and isn’t just added in the last few minutes of cooking.</p>

<p>I believe all the teriyaki dishes come with a small container of their teriyaki sauce, but I personally prefer the meat or “substance” (tofu, shrimp, salmon, etc.) of the dish by itself. Save that little sauce vessel for the huge side dishes of rice on them.</p>

<p>Okay, vegetable galore in this noodle dish. The amount of veggies in their yakisoba would be my criticism, but not for a dislike of veggies!! I enjoy vegetabless, but felt there was an imbalance of noodle to vegetable. I found this a bit odd, since restaurants typically try to overload with carbs rather than the more expensive vegetables. I enjoyed the chicken and the noodles, as I’m a huuuuuuge “thick egg-type” noodle fan, as opposed to thinner spaghetti-like types. Note that they cook their noodles a little under al-dente, so if you prefer less chewy noodles, just request them to be “fully cooked”.</p>

<p>Yakisoba for the win!</p>
