<p>I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, sheâ€™s only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, Iâ€™ve been itching to try making them too. Itâ€™s month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company. Catch the full story in the next couple weeks!</p>

<h6 id="yields-8-medium-croissants-but-you-can-make-16-smaller-ones-instead">Yields 8 medium croissants, but you can make ~16 smaller ones instead</h6>

<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Â¾ cup lukewarm milk</li>
  <li>â…› cup packed brown sugar</li>
  <li>1Â½ tsp active dry yeast</li>
  <li>3Â½ cups all-purpose flour <em>(may need as little as 3Â¼ or as much as 4 cups)</em></li>
  <li>Â¾ cup salted butter <em>if using unsalted butter, add Â½ tbsp salt</em></li>
  <li>Â½ egg for egg wash</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Lightly stir lukewarm milk, brown sugar, and yeast with a fork in your mixing bowl. Let sit for 5 minutes, until foamy.</li>
  <li>Add flour (and salt, <strong>if using unsalted butter</strong>) to the bowl 1 cup at a time, and mix until soft, elastic, but still a little bit sticky.
    <ul>
      <li>Start off with a sturdy spatula, then move on to kneading with your hands.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Loosely wrap the dough in plastic wrap and place the dough in a bowl. Refrigerate for one hour.</li>
  <li><strong>Make. The. Butter. Layer.</strong> Yâ€™all, this is the moment Iâ€™ve always wanted to experience. Cut the butter into evenly sized (especially the <strong>height</strong>; the width is less important). Arrange the layers into a rectangular formation onto a sheet of plastic wrap (what we did) or parchment paper (what we would recommend). Place another equally-sized sheet on top of the butter rectangle.
    <ul>
      <li>Parchment paper is a lot less clingy than plastic wrap, which is why we recommend it.</li>
      <li>The sheet of plastic/parchment should be considerably larger than the rectangle of butter. I recommend skipping to the <strong>[TIMESTAMP]</strong> to see how large our rectangle of wrap was.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use a rolling pin to roll out on all sides of the butter rectangle. Be very careful when rolling this butter rectangle out. The rectangle shouldnâ€™t be over rolled on any one side, as this would distort the rectangular formation. I recommend alternating the orientation of the rolling pin from vertical to horizontal several times through this process. See <strong>[TIMESTAMP]</strong> to get an idea of what we did in ours.
    <ul>
      <li>We had a pretty imperfect rectangle, so I wouldnâ€™t be discouraged if yours comes out a bit wonky looking. However, donâ€™t veer too far off the intended rectangle, and definitely try your best to attain that rectangle!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
