<p><strong><a href="https://mamieatery.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Ma Mì Eatery</a></strong> is a fast-casual Vietnamese eatery in Closter, and also the sister restaurant to the popular <strong><a href="http://simplyvietnamese.info/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Simply Vietnamese</a></strong> in Tenafly!</p>

<p>Ma Mì serves dishes like pho, banh mi, summer rolls, pad Thai, fried rice, salads, and bao buns. As a counter service restaurant, the service is quick, but the food is still made to order and always fresh!</p>

<p>My favorite Ma Mì dish is the <strong>original grilled pork banh mi</strong>. If you’ve never had banh mi, it’s a Vietnamese baguette that’s split open and filled to the brim with whatever ingredients your heart desired. Common to a typical banh mi, Ma Mì’s OG sandwich is stuffed with juicy grilled pork, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeño, and creamy aioli. Other common ingredients to this sandwich are paté and Maggi seasoning sauce.</p>

<p>While I’ll always stand by the original banh mi as my favorite, their <strong>pad Thai dumplings</strong> really set them apart from other places. These fried pockets of pad Thai wrapped with wonton skin burst with flavor, especially when combined with their sweet + sour Nuoc Mam sauce!</p>

<p>If you’re not feeling the extra crunch, they also make an incredible <strong>pad Thai</strong> that might not be traditional, but has a unique sweet and tangy taste. They make their pad Thai with thin rice noodles instead of the flat and wide noodles you might be used to seeing.</p>

<p>One more item I’d like to share is the <strong>50/50 Jasmine green tea and iced tea</strong> from their “secret menu”. With mild notes of green tea and a slightly sour, but still sweet enough, lemon flavor, this drink is especially perfect to cool down on a hot day! If you’re not a fan, they also serve a classic Thai Iced Tea that’s a little more sweet, but great any time of the year.</p>

<p>I’ve tried A LOT of foods from Ma Mì, and I can say with confidence that I’ve never had something I didn’t enjoy. If you’re in the area, be sure to put it on your list! It’s in the perfect location, being only 2 minutes away from Closter Plaza, where you can shop away and finish off with some dessert! What I love about Ma Mì is the modern take on Vietnamese food that is a great introduction for those who are new to it. They do it so well too!</p>
