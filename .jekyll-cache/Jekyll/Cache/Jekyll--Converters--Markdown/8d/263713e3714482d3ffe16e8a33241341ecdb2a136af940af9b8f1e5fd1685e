<p>I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, sheâ€™s only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, Iâ€™ve been itching to try making them too. Itâ€™s month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company. This collaboration is with my big sister, Antonia. She enjoys video-making and editing, so when the video is complete, the recipe will be up too! Catch the full story in the coming weeks!</p>
