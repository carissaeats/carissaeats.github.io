<p><em>Humm</em>-us where the heart is.</p>

<p>I get a little carried away with the puns during recipe posts, so bear with me.</p>

<p>My family had some pantry stuff we wanted to consume right away, so I came up with the idea to make a three-ish piece platter, with homemade pita, eggs in purgatory (kinda), and avocado hummus! The recipes for all three components will be posted within the next week! You wonâ€™t wanna miss my (almost) vegan platter.</p>
