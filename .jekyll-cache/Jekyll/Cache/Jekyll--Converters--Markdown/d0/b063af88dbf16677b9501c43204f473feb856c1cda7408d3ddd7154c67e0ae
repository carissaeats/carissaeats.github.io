I"<p>Beyond the glitz and glam of Disney World, Orlando is home to a thriving Viet cuisine scene in the Mills 50 (“Little Viet”), frequent food truck gatherings in Thornton Park, weekly farmers markets in multiple towns of the Orlando metro area, and many restaurants dedicated to beautiful fusion cuisines (did someone say <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maguro.pr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">sweet plantain sushi</a>?!)</p>

<p>My dad always planned to move out of NJ after I graduated high school, and now that the time has come, Orlando is my new home! I quite like it here – the sunshine, the food, the “perennial vacation” vibes. And with my college plans starting in January ‘22, it’s amazing that I got to close a chapter of my life in June, then get to open 2 new chapters in Orlando and soon, LA. Orlando is far more than just the Disney</p>
