I"'<p>Beyond the glitz and glam of Disney World, Orlando is home to a thriving Viet cuisine scene in the Mills 50 (“Little Vietnam”), frequent food truck gatherings in Thornton Park, weekly farmers markets in multiple towns of the Orlando metro area, and many restaurants dedicated to beautiful fusion cuisines (did someone say <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maguro.pr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">sweet plantain sushi</a>?!)</p>

<p>My dad always planned to move out of NJ after I graduated high school, and now that the time has come, Orlando is my new home! I quite like it here – the sunshine, the food, the “perennial vacation” vibes. And with my college plans starting in January ‘22, it’s amazing that I get to open 2 new chapters in Orlando and soon, <a href="/losangeleseats" class="nounderline">LA</a>, after closing a bittersweet chapter in Jersey.</p>

<p>20 million people visit Disney every year, but most visitors never see past the lifesize costumes and the nightly firework displays. And who can blame them (us? I feel like I’m the in-between a visitor and a resident)?! It’s hard not to leave with a huge smile (and sore feet) after a day there. Disney and Orlando are practically synonymous, but living here is teaching me to separate and appreciate the distinctiveness of the two.</p>

<p>Come back soon to see some of my favorite spots I’ve discovered so far!</p>
