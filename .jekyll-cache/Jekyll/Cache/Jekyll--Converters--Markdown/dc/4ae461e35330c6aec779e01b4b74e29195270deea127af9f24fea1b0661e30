<p>Welcome to my new recipe series, where I‚Äôm highlighting BIPOC creatives in the food industry!</p>

<p>This first release of the BIPOC Recipe Series spotlights Black recipe creators. I chose mostly independent creatives, because independent creatives have complete control over their narratives, meaning they are Black stories told by Black people. So without further ado, here are a few food storytelling communities and recipe sites comprised of Black voices.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://jikoni.co/recipes/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Jikoni</a></strong>: Jikoni means kitchen in Swahili. According to their website, Jikoni focuses on African culture and people, as African cuisine and stories are underrepresented in the culinary world. By looking through the lens of cuisine, people can learn about culture. ‚ÄúAll roads to lead to Africa‚Äù for Jikoni.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc8n9VxRO2ei45mXzZAJluA/videos" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Lady of Q</a></strong>: Sylvie Curry of <em>The American Barbecue Showdown</em> often used Asian-inspired flavors in their barbecue, but their range of cuisines spans all around the world. Sylvie may be a barbecue pitmaster, but that doesn‚Äôt stop them from crafting mouth-watering, non-BBQ recipes like the <a href="https://youtu.be/4FHmPPgP6MA" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Alaskan Seafood Feasts</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/DRN3Iyw9O1o" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Korean Crispy Corn Dogs</a>.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://meikoandthedish.com/tag/recipe/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Meiko and The Dish</a></strong>: Meiko Temple spent time in a Corporate America career of marketing and design, but ultimately, they found their passion in food. And what better way to combine design and culinary skills (along with a love for food!) than this beautiful blog! Meiko‚Äôs personal favorites are listed on the <a href="https://meikoandthedish.com/about-meiko/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">About</a> page, and the recipes are colorful, creative, and culinary delights (re: <a href="https://meikoandthedish.com/pink-spaghetti-beet-pesto/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pink Spaghetti</a> or <a href="https://meikoandthedish.com/elote-corn-chowder/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Elote Corn Chowder</a>)!</li>

<h4 id="-vegan-or-plant-forward">üå± Vegan (or Plant-Forward)</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.baumassfoods.com/category/recipes/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">baumassfoods</a></strong>: Hilaire follows a mostly vegan diet (‚Äúzero meat (even fish), very limited dairy, and very little egg‚Äù, according to the (About)[https://www.baumassfoods.com/about/]{:class=‚Äùnounderline‚Äù target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù} page). Hilaire is making ‚Äúbomb-ass, plant-forward food‚Äù and is showing the world that a plant-based lifestyle, if accessible, is as enjoyable (if not better than) as one with meat. I mean, are you <em>kidding</em> me with these <a href="https://www.baumassfoods.com/triple-chocolate-pistachio-cookies/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">triple chocolate pistachio cookies</a>, <a href="https://www.baumassfoods.com/bbq-jackfruit-bean-bowls-with-cornbread-croutons-and-coleslaw/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">bbq jackfruit bean bowls with cornbread croutons and coleslaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.baumassfoods.com/20-minute-creamy-skillet-lasagna/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">skillet lasagna</a>?! Warning: You may want to eat your screen after scrolling through their recipe feed. After all, Hilaire <em>is</em> a commercial food photographer in addition to running this blog.</li>

<p>Ways to Support BIPOC Bloggers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Many sites are supported by ads. If you use an ad blocker, please turn it off or remove it. If you see any ads that appeal to you (and look safe), click on them, as this may help the creatives get that revenue.</li>
  <li>Just show them some ‚ù§Ô∏è. Hit that follow button if you feel like you identify with their mission. Drive their Instagram engagement up by <strong>saving</strong>, <strong>sharing</strong>, or any other interactions. Followers aren‚Äôt always the goal, but enthusiastic and dedicated members of their Instagram communities are. Subscribe, like, and comment on YouTube channels, if they have them!</li>
  <li>Sign up for their Recipe Newsletters (typically a lightbox that appears on the screen or on the bottom).</li>
  <li>If their website has them, leave a review <em>if</em> you try their recipes <em>and</em> love them.</li>
</ol>
