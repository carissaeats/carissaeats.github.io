<p>Let’s think Chipotle, but elevated with fresh-from-the-sea fish and so many more combinations. I discovered <strong><a href="https://www.eatpokecrew.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Poke Crew</a></strong>Poke Crew’s grand opening through local food media company, <a href="https://boozyburbs.com" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Boozy Burbs</a>, and I don’t think I had ever been so excited for a restaurant opening up until that point. I had always wanted to go to Hawaii, not only because of its gorgeous landscape, but because of its rich culture that I would certainly love to explore one day. I love to read about dishes of different cultures, because I like to get excited for the future (and also to satisfy my wanderlust a little bit).</p>

<p>Although <strong><a href="https://www.eatpokecrew.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Poke Crew</a></strong> does have pre-set bowls for people who want to make less decisions in the day, everything is made-to-order, so custom bowls are endlessly possible. Once you walk past the Polaroid-adorned walls, you can go to the starting line and pick-up a laminated menu, where you can then use a marker to choose the items you’d like to put in your bowl. They have so many seafood options, ranging from the popular salmon and tuna (both cubed &amp; spicy tuna) to scallops, but also non-seafood options, like Berkshire pork belly, chicken teriyaki, tofu, + more.</p>

<p>After you pick your protein, you have a choice of 6 toppings, 2 sauces, and 4 garnishes. They have 20-ish toppings, 16 sauces, and 15 garnishes to choose from, so you’ll definitely have some have some decision making to do…</p>

<p>My typical order at Poke Crew is a white sushi rice / lettuce based bowl with either chicken or salmon, corn, inari (sweet tofu), mango, pineapple, pickled ginger, scallion, wasabi yuzu soy, either honey pineapple mayo or yuzukoshō (fermented chili-yuzu paste) mayo, crispy shallot, candied walnut (one of my favorites), nori, and finally, everything bagel spice. I truly believe every single topping adds something</p>

<p>Poke Crew puts a spin on popular dishes, like honey walnut shrimp, into poke bowls, where they use cooked shrimp, honey pineapple mayo, + glazed walnuts. They also have an “El Taco” bowl with white tuna, sweet corn, jalapeño, chipotle mayo, tortilla, &amp; more, and all of these pre-bowls can be substituted based on your preferences.</p>
