<p>Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pinklady Cheese Tart</a></strong> is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.</p>

Thereâ€™s no seating inside, which I wouldnâ€™t expect to change after the pandemic, given the storeâ€™s small space. Thereâ€™s a few back-of-the-house staff, but itâ€™s been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times Iâ€™ve been there.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, over just a</p>
