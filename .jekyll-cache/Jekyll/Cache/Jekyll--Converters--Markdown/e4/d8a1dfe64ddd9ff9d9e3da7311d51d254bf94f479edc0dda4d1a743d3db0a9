<p>Itâ€™s hard to say Iâ€™m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian-American. Iâ€™m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because Iâ€™m of Chinese descent, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian â€“ I â€œlookâ€ Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian-American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no look to being Asian-American (and that goes for various racial groups)! Yes, there are discussions to be had regarding colorism and being white-presenting/-assuming. But for those who proudly identify as Asian-American, itâ€™s dehumanizing to hear that you donâ€™t look Asian or to get the â€œno way youâ€™re Asianâ€ response. Itâ€™s stripping away a piece of someoneâ€™s identity.</p>

<p>Asia is a vast geographic region and is <em>roughly</em> divided into five sub-regions: Western Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia. Some people of Asian descent may not individually identify as Asian â€“ plus, nobody should be forced into a box, even though weâ€™re often required to put ourselves in them . But the point is, the Asian-American identity encompasses a wide range of ethnicities and cultures, so letâ€™s not be too quick to disrespect someone.</p>

<p>I can only speak for my experience as an East Asian, and most specifically, a Chinese-American. Iâ€™ll link additional Asian-American identity pieces at the very bottom, where you can explore the beautiful tapestry of Asian cultures and ethnoreligions.</p>

<h4 id="food-is">Food isâ€¦</h4>

<p>Emotional. Powerful. Uniting.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the first food that pops into your head when you hear, â€œAmerican foodâ€? Burgers? Grilled cheese? Mac and cheese?</p>

<p>Why is General Tso Chicken not on that list?</p>

<p>Why are BIPOC folx only allowed to be experts in foods of their heritage? Thatâ€™s not to discredit any white chefs. Good food is good food. Itâ€™s just frustrating when chefs of color donâ€™t garner <em>nearly</em> the same amount of awards.</p>

<p>Why are white Americans allowed to venture into any international cuisine, but Chinese Americans only allowed to cook egg rolls?</p>

<p>And people might be surprised to find out that most Chinese food isnâ€™t heavy or even deep-fried.</p>
