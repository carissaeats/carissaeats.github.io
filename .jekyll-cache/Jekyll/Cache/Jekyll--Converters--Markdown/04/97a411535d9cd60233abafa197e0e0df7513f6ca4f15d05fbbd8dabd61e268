I"ø<p>In January â€˜22, Iâ€™ll be heading out west to USC. Living in Los Angeles at some point in my life has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didnâ€™t know that this dream would become my reality so soon!</p>

<p>I have no clue where the next few years will take me professionally, but I do know what I want to be a big part of those next few years (and beyond):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Highlighting the stories behind foods</li>
  <li>Learning the history behind many cuisines</li>
  <li>Expanding my palate</li>
  <li>Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be</li>
  <li>Connecting with small businesses</li>
  <li>Being able to empathize with a more diverse group of people</li>
</ol>

<p>I couldnâ€™t feel more lucky to have the privilege to study at USC and the opportunity to experience life in Los Angeles</p>
