I"õ<p>Beyond the glitz and glam of Disney World, Orlando is home to a thriving Viet cuisine scene in the Mills 50 (â€œLittle Vietnamâ€), frequent food truck festivals in Thornton Park, weekly farmers markets across the Orlando metro area, and many restaurants dedicated to beautiful fusion cuisines (did someone say <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maguro.pr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">sweet plantain sushi</a>?!)</p>

<p>My dad always planned to move out of NJ after I graduated high school, and now that the time has come, Orlando is my new home! I quite like it here â€“ the sunshine, the food, the palm trees, the â€œperennial vacationâ€ vibes. I started college in January 2022, so I really had the time to settle into this new home and city. Itâ€™s amazing that I get to open 2 new chapters in Orlando and soon, <a href="/losangeleseats" class="nounderline">LA</a>, after closing a bittersweet chapter in Jersey.</p>

<p>20 million people visit Disney every year, but most visitors never see past the lifesize costumes and the nightly firework displays. And quite frankly, you may not even need to! Itâ€™s hard not to leave with a huge smile (and sore feet) after a day there. Disney and Orlando are practically synonymous with each other, but living here is teaching me to separate and appreciate the distinctiveness of the two.</p>

<p>So for those who are curious about life in Orlando or <em>are</em> interested in exploring past Disney, here are some of my favorite spots Iâ€™ve discovered so far!</p>
