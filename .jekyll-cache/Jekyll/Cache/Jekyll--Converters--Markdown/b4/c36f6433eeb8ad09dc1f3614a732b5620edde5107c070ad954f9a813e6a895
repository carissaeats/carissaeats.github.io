I"ã<p>Beyond the glitz and glam of Disney World, Orlando is home to a thriving Viet cuisine scene in the Mills 50 (â€œLittle Vietâ€), frequent food truck gatherings in Thornton Park, weekly farmers markets in multiple towns of the Orlando metro area, and many restaurants dedicated to beautiful fusion cuisines (did someone say <a href="https://www.instagram.com/maguro.pr/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">sweet plantain sushi</a>?!)</p>

<p>My dad always planned to move out of NJ after I graduated high school, and now that the time has come, Orlando is my new home! I quite like it here â€“ the sunshine, the food, the â€œperennial vacationâ€ vibes. And with my college plans starting in January â€˜22, itâ€™s amazing that I got to close a chapter of my life in June, then get open two new chapters in Orlando and soon, LA.</p>
