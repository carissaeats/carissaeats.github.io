I"-<p>In January ‘22, I’ll be heading out west to USC. Living in Los Angeles at some point in my life has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didn’t know that this dream would become my reality so soon!</p>

<p>I have no clue where the next few years will take me professionally, but I do know what I want to be a big part of those next few years (and beyond).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Highlighting the stories behind foods</li>
  <li>Learning the history behind cuisines</li>
  <li>Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be</li>
  <li>Connecting with small businesses and empathizing with many people</li>
</ol>
