I"û<p>In January â€˜22, Iâ€™ll be heading out west to USC. Living in Los Angeles at some point in my life has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didnâ€™t expect this dream to become my reality so soon!</p>

<p>I have no clue where the next few years will take me professionally, but I do have know what I want to be a big part of those next few years (and beyond).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Highlighting the stories behind foods</li>
  <li>Learning about the history of many cuisines</li>
  <li>Connecting with small businesses and empathizing with people</li>
  <li>F</li>
</ol>
