<p>Iâ€™ve learned to cook with my grandma, as well as through watching lots of Youtube and my favorite Food Network stars, but I still have so much to learn.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite foods include xiaolongbao, cheeseburgers, tsukemen, poke bowls, and okonomiyaki. I also love boba tea and basically any dessert you can think of.</p>

<p>I think food is the one thing that is able to connect so many people. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, itâ€™s very likely that you guys have had some similar food experiences.</p>

<p>With cooking comes many different stories, and living in America has allowed me to experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places.</p>

<p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>

<p>My goal for this webpage is to share some of my favorite places to find ~affordable eats~ (no Michelin-star meals here!). Food is something Iâ€™m so grateful to be able to enjoy every day, and I just want to capture the best moments. Whether it be cooking with my grandma or exploring tasty eats, it is something I hope everyone can enjoy along with me.</p>

<p>I have been blessed with numerous travel opportunities. Food has undoubtedly been my favorite part of every experience, 
whether itâ€™s eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or shakshuka in Israel. Iâ€™ve shared the destinations Iâ€™ve visited in my <strong><a href="/beyond.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">beyond</a></strong> page!</p>
