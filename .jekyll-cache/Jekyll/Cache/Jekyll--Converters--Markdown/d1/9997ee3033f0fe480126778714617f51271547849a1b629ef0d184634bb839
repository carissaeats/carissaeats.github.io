<p>Life update: Iâ€™ve moved to The Swamp!</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m pursuing my Master of Public Health at the University of Florida. From being here for just a couple months at this point, I already absolutely love it here. Iâ€™m a mere 1.5 hour away from home, meaning I see my grandma and dad way more often. Gainesville is lined with trees and endless outdoors to explore, which has been a beautfiul thing to experience. Iâ€™ve also been able to incorporate sustainable habits that Iâ€™ve been looking to do so with convenience and affordability for years â€“Â like shopping at a refillery (<a href="http://localhost:4000" class="nounderline">Life Unplastic</a>), supporting local markets, and composting. Iâ€™ve started cooking and baking so much more â€“ I got a stand mixer off of Marketplace that has proved to be one of the best investments of the year. Iâ€™ve picked up crochet and committed to playing more pickleball as a solo at local courts. And most importantly, Iâ€™ve met some of the kindest people ever and cultivated a wonderful support network here. It just feels like I finally have all the ingredients Iâ€™ve been looking for to invest in myself and create the life Iâ€™ve always dreamed of.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m excited to show everyone all the lovely places and things that have made Gainesville feel like home in such a short time. It has so much more than meets the eye â€“ from food to activities, Iâ€™ve been having a blast exploring the scene here.</p>

<p>Also, if you happen to be a reader that I havenâ€™t been in touch with recently â€“Â even if itâ€™s been a while, I would love to hear from you! Especially if youâ€™re planning to visit Florida at any point â€“Â thereâ€™s few things I love more than showing people from my other worlds the place I live in now.</p>
