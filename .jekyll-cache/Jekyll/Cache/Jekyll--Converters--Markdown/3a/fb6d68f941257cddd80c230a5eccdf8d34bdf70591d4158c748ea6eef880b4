<p>Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pinklady Cheese Tart</a></strong> is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.</p>

<p>You might be unfamiliar with the Hokkaido cheese tarts that Pinklady is inspired by. Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island, has a massive countryside that can support a successful dairy industry. According to <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5312.html" class="nounderline" target="_blank">japan-guide.com</a>, half of Japan‚Äôs milk is produced on this island, and their dairy products are highly regarded in across the country. The tarts supposedly originated in a bakery in Hokkaido‚Äôs capital of Sapporo, obviously using those quality dairy products. Hokkaido is one of my top bucket-list destinations, not only for the food, but for the nature (flowers, volcanoes, etc.), hot springs, skiing, and so much more.</p>

<p>These cheese tarts should not be confused with the popular Hong Kong egg tarts or Portuguese/Macanese past√©is de nata, as those tarts are filled with a silky sweet custard, while cheese tarts are made with oozy cheese mousse. The crusts on the other two are typically puff pastry like, while cheese tart shells are more comparable to a cookie.</p>

<h6 id="fun-fact-these-tarts-typically-contain-three-types-of-cheese-cream-cheese-mascarpone-cheese-and-the-most-surprising-one-parmesan-cheese-the-parmesan-does-not-make-these-tarts-savory---i-think-that-a-small-amount-adds-slight-saltiness-and-nuttiness-that-balances-the-sweetness-of-this-dessert">Fun fact: these tarts typically contain THREE types of cheese: cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and the most surprising one, parmesan cheese! The parmesan does NOT make these tarts savory - I think that a small amount adds slight saltiness and nuttiness that balances the sweetness of this dessert.</h6>

<p>My first experience with a cheese tart was in Taiwan, where I tried a boba-filled cheese tart - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. Although the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese itself that really stood out. Since then, I‚Äôve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me. When I saw <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmiUUdHTPM/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">this post</a> by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeaniuseats/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">@jeaniuseats</a>, I was ECSTATIC!! The location of Pinklady was perfect, as my dad and I stop by Mott Street almost monthly, so I made it a target stop on our next trip.</p>

<p>Pinklady may not be the first cheese tart in Manhattan, but they are one of the only NYC businesses really specializing in cheese tarts. They only sell two products, one being their array of tarts, and the other being their housemade rice yogurt drinks, which I‚Äôve heard lovely things about too.</p>

<p>The store‚Äôs giant yellow sign sticks out like a sore thumb on Chinatown‚Äôs ‚Äúunofficial Main Street‚Äù that‚Äôs packed with the lucky Chinese color of red. There‚Äôs no seating inside, which I wouldn‚Äôt expect to change after the pandemic, given the store‚Äôs small space. There‚Äôs a few back-of-the-house staff, but it‚Äôs been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times I‚Äôve been there.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, which is not always an easy find at bakeries and restaurants.</p>

<p>Well anyways, you‚Äôll see that there are ‚Äúsneeze guard‚Äù dividers to protect the tarts from any customers (who must wear a mask inside too), and the tarts are lined up on Silpats and plastic trays. They currently offer five flavors of <strong>original cheese</strong>, <strong>matcha</strong>, <strong>ube</strong> (purple yam), <strong>chocolate</strong>, and <strong>strawberry-filled chocolate</strong>. I‚Äôve tried all, but the chocolate one, since I‚Äôm not the <em>biggest</em> fan of chocolate (I‚Äôm prepared to get some hate mail‚Ä¶). My favorite is the matcha, because the strong matcha flavor really does shine through, but you really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of these.</p>

<p>Now, about those temperatures I was talking about, there four ways to enjoy these tarts. It‚Äôs almost like four different dessert types that range from firm, cheesecake-like to molten lava cake. Putting the tart in the fridge will make the flowy inside firm up like a cheesecake, while putting it in the oven / air-fryer will make the inside hot and ooze of lava cheese. The other two ways are the most similar, which are just warming the tarts up in the microwave and eating it plain-Jane room temperature. My personal favorite is room-temperature, because I still get a slightly flowy inside while retaining a cheesecake texture on the outer parts of the filling, but even just the versatility of how this dessert can be consumed is so unique.</p>

<p>While I do love myself a flaky HK egg tart crust, Pinklady double bakes their tart shells, making for a crispier, slightly toasted tartlet.</p>

<p>I was beyond satisfied with my stop at Pinklady. My dad and I fought over the last cheese tart, because these are just that good (we ended up splitting it). Opening at the peak of the pandemic in April is no easy feat, and although there are many old staples in Chinatown that deserve an equal amount of appreciation, Pinklady is a great addition to an already fantastic, robust neighborhood dessert scene. Be sure to pay a visit at your next stop in Chinatown!</p>
