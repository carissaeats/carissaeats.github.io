<p>To me, honey walnut shrimp is the emblem of Chinese American food to me. Even as a Chinese American myself, I ate this dish way more than any sesame or orange chicken â€“Â it was a fixture on many group dinners with the other Chinese American kids, like a guilty pleasure amongst actual Chinese food. While a katsu sandwich restaurant was already exciting, imagine my enthusiasm skyrocketing when I saw this delectable item on the menu. Thereâ€™s real chunks of shrimp inside that form a patty, and itâ€™s breaded like all the other katsu items on the menu. Add those candied walnuts â€“Â which we always fought over as kids â€“Â with the slaw and creamy honey aioli, and you have a sandwich that both feels new and stirs up the best memories of childhood dinners. I love this sandwich so much, that when I got sent to university-sponsored COVID housing, this was the first thing I ordered using the delivery credit I was gifted â˜ºï¸</p>

<p>Hangari is certainly not the only place to do kalguksu, but theyâ€™re masters at it and making sure you donâ€™t leave hungry. They start you off with a lovely assortment of banchan â€“ I always love to see the ultra thin pickled pink radishes â€“Â and a small bowl of brown rice and gochujang. And then they bust out with a huge bowl of noodle soup that can happily feed 2, especially if you account for the unlimited banchan. The broth is so rich in umami from the anchovies (maturing is realizing anchovies are flavor bombs without being fishy), coating the noodles perfectly in each bite.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve never walked out of here with anything less than a very hearty afternoon snack for the next day â€“Â and it brings the same joy even a day later.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been over 2 years since Iâ€™ve had these skewers (which is probably why itâ€™s only number 10 on my list), and I still think about how perfect they are. First of all, the price for 3 skewers is definitely not cheap, but these are not your average mini kabobs â€“ there are huge chunks of pork on each skewer. These beauties are charred excellently, which brings out the best of the sugar in the marinade. Also, I know Thai food has a reputation for being on the sweet side, but the sweetness on these is golden with the punch of umami from the marinade sauces. Also, pair these with some sticky rice for a texturally divine palate cleanser between bites.</p>

<p>Shocked I only went here once, considering that I spread the (loving) gospel about this place all the time. Their hours arenâ€™t great, only being open from 12-6 a few days a week, which makes it hard to slot in for a dinner. But this shrimp is so juicy and buttery that even at 6 pieces, you will leave feeling like you got a massive bang for your buck. I know mac salad is perhaps more traditional, but their Korean greens in my opinion are almost a necessity to cut the richness of the shrimp. Also, Lee (the namesake and owner) is so friendly, and he even offered me and my friend (a regular there) free ALOHA Maid POG juices.</p>

<p>Holbox is just about an LA legend â€“ thereâ€™s nothing quite like the ultra fresh seafood tacos, ceviches, aguachiles, cocteles, tostadas, and entrees that they make. The restaurant is named from the island off Mexicoâ€™s northern YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, pronounced â€œhole-bosh.â€ This is one of the restaurants on this list that Iâ€™ve visited the most, and for that, I am so grateful. Iâ€™ve gotten kanpachi tacos and tostadas, as well as their shrimp entree, but the one dish I almost always get is their octopus taco. I love a grilled octopus, and it just works so well with the citrus, scallions, and squid ink sofrito itâ€™s paired with.</p>

<p>At Holbox, you can really take your pick between seafood thatâ€™s fresh off the grill, lightly fried, or literally fresh from the sea (usually â€œflash-cookedâ€ with citrus, like through preparations of ceviche and aguachile). Arguably the most famous restaurants on this list (with the exception of Portoâ€™s maybe), Holbox is the hard-earned recipient of many accolades, including 1 Michelin Star. USC students are the luckiest to be a mere Fryft ride away from this establishment, and itâ€™s surely one of the best treat-yourself-meals you can find as a college student.</p>

<p><em>Also, Iâ€™ve had food from a majority of the stalls in Mercado La Paloma, and theyâ€™ve all been wonderful â€“Â would highly recommend checking this food hall out!</em></p>

<p>Thanking my sister for bringing these life-changing egg rolls into my life. Unlike many other egg rolls Iâ€™ve had, these egg rolls are wrapped in <em>rice paper</em>, which brings about the characteristic puffy and bubbly skin that arises from frying rice paper. Itâ€™s significantly better than egg roll wrappers, in my opinion! Their pork filling is also generously seasoned, which makes the filling a more prominent player in this egg roll than maybe others Iâ€™ve had. At $15.50, they arenâ€™t cheap, but they are much bigger than your average cháº£ giÃ², and this would be a nutritious (with the plentiful greens) and hearty meal for one person.</p>

<p>I love a bento box, because sometimes I find myself getting bored of eating if Iâ€™m just eating, letâ€™s say, a bowl of pasta with no sides. A bento box incorporates diversity in the eating experience, because every bite will be something different. Guzzu Bento-Ya offers a delicious mix of fresh and roasted vegetables, a delightful protein of your choice, and a hefty bed of rice to cleanse your palate in between bites. While the portion size is not huge, I would say itâ€™ll leave you satiated (especially with the rice) and the karaage pieces are quite big. An exceptional treat yourself lunch!</p>

<p>One of my friends had been telling me about the gospel of Jitlada for several years â€“Â and Iâ€™m so glad in the beginning of this year, she decided to accompany me on my first visit to her favorite restaurant. Specifically, this crispy morning glory salad was a legend. I canâ€™t even explain what made it so good. The fried morning glory was light and tossed in a sweet, sour, and spicy dressing that was accentuated by some sharp sliced red onions. The fresh shrimp was a delightful surprise â€“Â they were so slightly poached so that the texture was perfectly tender and succulent.</p>

<p>I will say that the wait on a Sunday night was still close to an hour â€“Â which primed my stomach for an intense desire to eat â€“ but I still believe this salad wouldâ€™ve changed my life even on a full stomach.</p>

<p>One of my deep regrets is not returning to Jitlada by myself before I left <em>just</em> to eat this salad (and maybe an order of sticky rice). But as I always say, that might just mean another reason to return.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure that I will ever have a ground meat dish as good as this ever again. The meat is delectably seasoned, and the char from their preparation brings out the best of the spices they use. Pairing it with their specialty cherry rice also just adds the perfect sweet balance to the ultra-savory meat they serve (plus Iâ€™m a sucker for sweet and salty). At $22.99, itâ€™s one of the pricier dishes on the list, but each koobideh is quite lengthy â€“Â and I could definitely see this being split into two meals depending on your capacity that day.</p>

<p>A member of the community center I worked at had been recommending Zombie Chicken to me for months. He lives just a 5 minute walk from it and kept telling me it was a hidden gem. He was absolutely right â€“ the inside is no frills, has just four tables, and thereâ€™s minimal separation between the kitchen and seating area â€“ but they deliver a fantastic meal at an extremely great price.</p>

<p>Zombie Chicken earned my #2 spot, because the price is unbeatable, the offerings are two of my favorite foods (jajangmyeon and Korean fried chicken), and the service is quick and kind. The $4.99 jajangmyeon was advertised as an opening special, but even the regular price is only $7.99. Add that to the $8.99 wing special, and you have yourself a perfect amount of food for 2 people at less than $10 per person. Zombie Chicken deserves all the love â€“ serving food of this quality at this price point in <em>this</em> economy is heartwarming.</p>

<p>Formerly known as Avenue 26, this taco stand is a religious experience.</p>

<p>Amongst all the options on this list, I gave them my top spot, because if someone asked me to give them one recommendation, Avenue 26 is affordable, filling, fresh, and is simply emblematic of the taco stands I miss so dearly about Los Angeles.</p>

<p>To be honest, I couldnâ€™t even tell you which meats I got. I usually just ask them for 5-6 tacos and tell them to pick the meats for me. Chefâ€™s choice has never failed me! And plus, once these tacos hit the plate, I just keep picking them up until thereâ€™s none left on the plate.</p>

<p>But what distinguishes Avenue 26 from other taco stands Iâ€™ve been to is two things: 1) the unlimited (at least previously) grilled onions you can top your tacos with and 2) the most glorious boiled potato you might ever have. Yelp reviewers say the potato costs an extra 50 cents, but to me, itâ€™s an essential. Itâ€™s soaked in the juices of one of the meats they cook, and I think itâ€™s the perfect palate cleanser in between your tacos. But as someone who loves grilled onions especially, I simply have the utmost adoration for their generosity. They also have a self-serve salsa and topping (your typical onions, cilantro, lime, pico de gallo, etc.) stand, so you can load up as you see fit.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve never had a taco in Southern California (or of course, Mexico), Avenue 26 might just rock your whole taco world.</p>
