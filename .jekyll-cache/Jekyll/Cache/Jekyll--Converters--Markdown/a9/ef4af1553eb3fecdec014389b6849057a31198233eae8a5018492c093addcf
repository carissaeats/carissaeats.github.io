<p>Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Pinklady Cheese Tart</a></strong> is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.</p>

<p>When I was in Taiwan, I got to try a boba-filled cheese tart - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. But also the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese that really shined through. Since then, Iâ€™ve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me.
