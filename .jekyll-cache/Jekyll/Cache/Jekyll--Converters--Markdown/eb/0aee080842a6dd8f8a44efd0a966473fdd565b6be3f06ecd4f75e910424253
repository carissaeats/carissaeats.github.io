<p>The reason I look back on Asia especially fondly is because the foods I‚Äôve grown up eating and learned to love here in the states truly felt at home in Asia ‚Äì which seems obvious, but only becomes more apparent when you finally go. Yes, the Asian food in America is undisputedly excellent, but the Asian food IN Asia is on another level. The meals can be so simple and ‚Äúbare bones‚Äù, but are elevated when compared to how they taste in America. Chefs in the states who immigrated from Asia often need to adjust their flavorings to pander to a wide variety of taste buds, whereas chefs in China are catering to mostly Chinese consumers, allowing them to stick to their more traditional methods. These photos are from my summer in Asia in 2018, where I was introduced to so many new dishes and elevations of ones I already knew. My dad grew up in China, so he knows his way around and has some fun tidbits to add about some of the foods we tried, which only added to this incredible experience of staying in China. I will also preface this post by saying that a lot of the foods I‚Äôm sharing below are non-traditional, but I ate plenty of traditionally Cantonese dishes during my time - I was just enjoying the moment and couldn‚Äôt snap a photo!</p>

<p>This post will include mostly photos, but I‚Äôll write about any foods that may need more of a description, connections to other cultures, or have a story I want to share. While I don‚Äôt have the exact restaurant names, keep these dishes on your list for the future!</p>

<p>We didn't have a ton of stops on our trip, but that just meant we got to spend some more time at each! First is the <strong>Chiang Kai Shek Memorial</strong>, as Chiang Kai-shek, the former leader of the Chinese Nationalist Party, died in Taipei. The memorial had multiple exhibits, so be sure to check those out when you're there.</p>
<p>Next, we checked out <strong>Yangmingshan National Park</strong>, where there was a volcano, along with a ton of grass-lined valleys and COWS! Definitely smelled like cow dung, but an enjoyable experience nonetheless.</p>
<p>Now...onto the <strong>National Palace Museum</strong>, home to the Jade Bok Choy and Dongpo Pork Stone! You can see how intricate the details are - they perfectly walk the fine line between ultra-elegant and realistic. </p>

<li><strong>Tian Tan Buddha</strong>, or as it's informally known, the Big Buddha! Wow, it was a <em>journey</em> to get here. You first hop on a gondola, the ride of which took about 30-45 minutes one way, and then, take a decent walk to the steps of the Buddha. The Buddha sits above a hilltop, and the steps are no joke. However, I was truly in awe of this bronze masterpiece, beyond its sheer magnitude. I am nonreligious (I don't even know what I really identify as), but according to the <a href="https://www.plm.org.hk/eng/buddha.php" target="_blank" class="nounderline">Po Lin Monastery</a>, the statue, which "symbolizes the stability of Hong Kong, prosperity of China and peace on earth", took 12 years to plan and build. It wasn't ridiculously loud at the top, and I appreciated the peacefulness of the attraction. The Buddha would be very close to the top of my list for places I would like to return to. </li>
<li>The Former <strong>Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower</strong> is a symbol of "moving on" for the Chinese immigrants who passed through this terminus of Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway to start new lives in Hong Kong. My dad told us we had to visit this clock tower, since my mom and him used to stop by.</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Gardens by the Bay</strong>: One of the most famous Singaporean attractions, you can find beautiful flora and incredible architecture in any of the sub-exhibitions. I visited the Cloud Forest (where this photo was taken) and the Flower Dome. They also have a musical light show at night to check out - it's <em>free</em>, and you just lie down on a  blanket and look up!</li>
<li><strong>Mount Faber Peak</strong>: take the Singapore Cable Car up to Faber Peak. There's a giant Bell of Happiness, but also a fence to tie your personalized mini bell.</li>
<li>Antonia in front of the <strong>Marina Bay Sands</strong>, arguably one of the most famous hotels in the world. </li>
<li>This <strong>Merlion</strong> is the national symbol of Singapore, but also a bit of an inside joke in my family. When my dad decided put Singapore as one of our destinations, he also was adamant about us seeing the giant Merlion. But this one...is ~only~ 8.6 meters tall. Not that it's not huge, but my dad kept saying that the Merlion he visited thirty years ago was far, far taller AND that the giant one was the original Merlion. So we kept looking up "giant Merlion" on Google, but we couldn't find it! Eventually, we discovered it was on Sentosa Island, which is certainly still in Singapore, just not as centrally located. Luckily, Singapore is quite small, so we made the trip to see the lovely Sentosa Merlion, which BTW, is a replica. This one is THIRTY SEVEN meters tall! You can ride an elevator up this giant replica, but we decided it wasn't worth the price. As I was writing this, I unfortunately found out it was permanently closed and demolished just over a year ago üòû But I am grateful I got to see it before Singapore had to say goodbye.</li>
</ol>
<p>Without further ado, this is the giant Merlion...</p>
