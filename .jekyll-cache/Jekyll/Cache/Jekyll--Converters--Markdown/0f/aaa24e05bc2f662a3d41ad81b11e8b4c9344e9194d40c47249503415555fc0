<p>Itâ€™s hard to say Iâ€™m proud to be an American when many people will never see me as one.</p>

<p>I am Asian-American. Iâ€™m of East Asian descent, and I identify as Chinese-American, to be specific. Because I am East Asian, I am what most people see when they think of someone whose Asian â€“ I â€œlookâ€ Asian to many, so my experience identifying as Asian-American is rarely invalidated.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no look to being Asian-American (and that goes for various racial groups)! Yes, there are discussions to be had regarding colorism and being white-presenting/-assuming. But for those who proudly identify as Asian-American, itâ€™s dehumanizing to hear that you donâ€™t look Asian or to get the â€œno way youâ€™re Asianâ€ response. Itâ€™s stripping away a piece of someoneâ€™s identity.</p>

<p>Asia is a vast geographic region and is <em>roughly</em> divided into five sub-regions: Western Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, East Asia, and Central Asia. Some people of Asian descent may not individually identify as Asian â€“ plus, nobody should be forced into a box, even though weâ€™re often required to put ourselves in them . But the point is, the Asian-American identity encompasses a wide range of ethnicities and cultures, so letâ€™s not be too quick to disrespect someone.</p>

<p>I can only speak for my experience as an East Asian, and most specifically, a Chinese-American. Iâ€™ll link additional Asian-American identity pieces at the very bottom, where you can explore the beautiful tapestry of Asian cultures and ethnoreligions.</p>

<h4 id="food-is">Food isâ€¦</h4>

<p>Emotional. Powerful. Uniting.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the first food that pops into your head when you hear, â€œAmerican foodâ€? Burgers? Grilled cheese? Mac and cheese?</p>

<p>My elementary school encouraged me to view America as a melting pot. <em>America as a melting pot is a myth</em> (for now). Yes, itâ€™s true that immigrants have brought pieces of their culture to the U.S., but their contributions, particularly those of non-white immigrants, are severely undervalued and exploited.</p>

<p>Why is sesame chicken not on that list? Sesame chicken is a dish I hate to love. I wonâ€™t deny anyone of the dishâ€™s tastiness, but white people who feel entitled to my heritage/culture just because they bought the $9 combo plate at Good Taste are obnoxious. <strong>Chinese food is more than sesame chicken.</strong> People might be surprised to find out that most Chinese food isnâ€™t heavy or even deep-fried.</p>

<p>For example, white people will participate in Cinco de Mayo happy hours, wear racially insensitive costumes, and say they love tacos â€“ but theyâ€™ll support ICE (<a href="https://abolish-ice.carrd.co/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Abolish ICE.</a>) and endorse Trumpâ€™s abhorrent labelling of Mexicans as criminals and drug lords. The most of Mexican culture theyâ€™ll even <em>tolerate</em> is tacos and tequila.</p>

<p>Why are white Americans allowed to venture into any international cuisine, but Chinese Americans only allowed to cook egg rolls? Why are BIPOC folx only allowed to be experts in foods of their heritage? Thatâ€™s not to discredit any white chefs. Good food is good food. Itâ€™s just frustrating when chefs of color donâ€™t garner <em>nearly</em> the same amount of awards. For example, there are Black and Asian French people who are French cuisine connoisseurs, yet the â€œFrench culinary greatsâ€ are all white (look up â€œbest French chefâ€ on Google). Whereâ€™s the proper recognition for BIPOC chefs?</p>

<h4 id="i-wont-be-a-movie-stereotype">I wonâ€™t be a movie stereotype.</h4>

<p>Why are white people with French or Italian accents fawned over, but any BIPOC individual with an accent is immediately othered and deemed foreign, oriental (ğŸ™„), or weird? If I had to think of a reason why, Iâ€™d attribute the double standard to television and movie depictions. Thereâ€™s the French lover and Fabio movie tropes, but BIPOC are characters used as an obstacle to the â€œtrue love storyâ€ or reduced to racist stereotypes.</p>

<h4 id="final-remarks">Final Remarks</h4>

<p>To the white people who go to my high school â€“ one with a predominantly East and South Asian student body â€“ you are not â€œbasically Asianâ€. You can love the food, but you do not get to claim the most palatable forms of Asian-ness only when itâ€™s most convenient for you.</p>

<p>Do not put the burden of anti-Asian racism on other BIPOC.</p>

<p>The U.S. was a country made for white people â€“ specifically cisgender, straight, white, and male. If you donâ€™t fit that box, people will make you feel less than you really are.</p>
