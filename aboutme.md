Hey! My name is Carissa Liu (she/her), a Jersey girl who's now calling Orlando her new home. Welcome to my food, travel, and personal blog!

I started to be curious about my grandma’s kitchen endeavors around 7 years old, and I turned that curiosity into cooking show and culinary YouTube marathons. I cook with my grandma often, but bake with my sister too, which you’ll see more in the upcoming months. 

I learned that with every bite of food, there’s a story that comes with it. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, it’s very likely that you've shared similar food experiences. With cooking comes diverse stories, and living in America has allowed me to build bridges between various cultures through the wide variety of food experiences available here.

Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.

I’ll be releasing interviews with food establishment owners, recipes for anyone to follow, stories attached to my favorite eats, and even foodie T.V. moments. My writing is super informal, so I hope [@CarissaEats]({{site.url}}){:class="nounderline"} allows my viewers to enjoy food alongside me. To have healthy food on the table, let alone a positive relationship with food, is a privilege, and I do (and will) not take that for granted.

My **[beyond page](/beyond){:class="nounderline"}** will share some destinations I’ve been blessed to explore (with food as the highlight), whether it's eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or beignets in New Orleans.

In just a few months, I'll be heading out to [Los Angeles](/losangeleseats){:class="nounderline"} for college. Jersey will forever have a spot spot in my heart (I always say, "be back soon" 💛), but I feel lucky to be adding TWO (!) new hubs of O-Town and L.A. to my blog.
