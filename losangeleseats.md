I've headed out west to go to college! Living in Los Angeles has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didn't know this dream would become my reality so soon! 

I visited my sister in LA in 2018 ([I wrote a recap here](/beyond/losangeles){:class="nounderline"}), and I still reflect on it as one of the happiest weekends of my life. And the best part is, my love for this city has only grown.

I have no clue where the next few years will take me, but I do know what I want to prioritize in the future:

1. Highlighting the stories behind foods
1. Learning the history behind a variety of cuisines
1. Expanding my palate
1. Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be
1. Connecting with small businesses
1. Empathizing with more diverse groups of people

Come back soon to catch some of my fun adventures over the last few months ðŸ˜Š I love you, LA!
