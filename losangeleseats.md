In January '22, I'll be heading out west to USC. Living in Los Angeles has been on my list of dreams for many years now. Just a few months ago, I didn't know this dream would become my reality so soon! 

I visited my sister in LA in 2018 ([I wrote a recap here](/beyond/losangeles){:class="nounderline"}), and I always say it was one of the happiest weekends of my life. While I don't expect every day to exactly mirror that weekend, it just makes me optimistic about my future there ðŸ˜Š

I have no clue where the next few years will take me, but I do know what I want to prioritize in the future:

1. Highlighting the stories behind foods
1. Learning the history behind a variety of cuisines
1. Expanding my palate
1. Discovering how different fusion cuisines came to be
1. Connecting with small businesses
1. Being able to empathize with a more diverse group of people

Can't wait to see you soon, LA!
