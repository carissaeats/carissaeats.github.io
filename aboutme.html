      <p>Ever since I started watching Food Network at the age of 8, 
        I've fallen in love with food. 
        I've learned to cook with my grandma, as well as through watching lots of Youtube and 
        my favorite Food Network stars, but I still have so much to learn.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favorite foods include xiaolongbao, cheeseburgers, tsukemen, poké bowls, and okonomiyaki. 
        I also love boba tea and basically any dessert you can think of.</p>
      <p>I think food is the one thing that is able to connect so many people. 
        Even if you live half way across the world from someone, it's very likely that you guys have had some similar food experiences. 
      <p>With cooking comes many different stories, and living in America has allowed me to 
        experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places. 
      </p>
      <p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, 
        and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and
        learn more about my own history and culture by living with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal for my webpage is to share some of my favorite places to find affordable eats. 
        Food is something we enjoy every day, and I just want to capture the moment. 
        I am so thankful to have a great relationship with food, 
        and it is something that I hope everyone can enjoy along with me. 
      </p>
      <p>I also love to travel and have been blessed with numerous travel opportunities. 
        Food has undoubtedly been my favorite part of every experience, 
        whether it's eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or 
        shakshuka in Israel. I've shared the destinations I've visited in my <a class="nounderline" href="/beyond.html" target="_blank">beyond</a> page!</p>
      <p>See you soon,</p>
      <p>Carissa 😊</p>
