      <p>Ever since I started watching Food Network at the age of 8, I've fallen in love with food. 
        I've learned to cook with my grandma, as well as through watching lots of Youtube and my favorite Food Network stars. 
        I still have so so much to learn though!
      </p>
      <p>Some of my favorite foods include Shake Shack cheeseburgers, Pad Thai, xiaolongbao, poké bowls, ribeye steak, and okonomiyaki. 
        I also love boba tea, and basically any dessert you can think of.</p>
      <p>I think food is the one thing that is able to connect so many people. 
        Even if you live half way across the world from someone, it's very likely that you guys have had some similar food experiences. 
        Living in America has allowed me to experience many different types of food from a wide variety of places, which has taught me so much about different cultures around the world.</p>
      <p>I am first generation American, coming from a Chinese heritage. Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, 
        and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking 
        while learning more about my own history and culture by living with her.
      </p>
      <p>I've also been blessed with numerous travel opportunities, having been to Israel, Canada, Finland, and London, as well as lots of East Asia! Food has undoubtedly been my favorite part of every experience, whether it's eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or shakshuka in Israel.</p>
      <p>See you soon,</p>
      <p>Carissa 😊</p>
