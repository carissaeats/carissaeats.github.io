<p><strong><a href="http://www.yama-nyc.com/" class="nounderline" target="_blank">Yama Sushi</a></strong> is definitely a spot you’d skip over at first glance. It has an unassuming, dark exterior to go along with its basement location, so it wouldn’t be somewhere I’d choose initially, but this restaurant is my dad’s favorite place in New York. About 20 years ago, my dad used to commute to work in Manhattan before he switched to working at home, but he discovered Yama with his coworkers in the early days of his job. The basement-esque location we go to now is different than the one he used to go to, but he says this one is just as good!</p>

<p>My dad loves to eat fish, especially sashimi, and even though I’m really not a big fan of fish, I do like sashimi and sushi. I hope that I’ll be able to explore Japan one day to try authentic food, but for now, Yama serves high-quality, thinly sliced sashimi fish that keeps my family super happy. The “<strong>sashimi entree</strong>” of assorted sashimi is my dad’s favorite meal to eat. The sashimi is sliced thinner than a lot of sushi restaurants do, with pieces that are longer too. They are served on top of perilla leaves that are a perfect palate cleanser, and eating rice in between slices is recommended too. I wish I could tell you the types of fish in this selection, but I can definitely say there’s salmon and tuna (sorry!).</p>

<p>While my sister and dad get the sashimi entree, I opt for a <strong>hot dish-sushi combo bento box</strong>. A bento is simply a box of an assortment of rice/noodles, meat, &amp; vegetables that’s very popular throughout East Asia. The photo at the very top is the lunch version, where you can choose 2 entrees out of many options, such as tonkatsu, ginger pork, tempura, sushi, hamachi kama, just to name a few. I love their chicken karaage, and even though I haven’t had a huge amount of karaage, this is my personal favorite! I also get their sushi, which is nigiri-style, which is just a slice of raw fish over sushi rice. I have noticed that the raw fish used on the sushi is warmer and not as high-quality as the sashimi alone, but it’s still great. The steam from the rice does wlightly warm the raw fish a bit, so it’s not the very chilled temperature that the sashimi retains. The box is accompanied with fresh orange slices and broiled fish - even for those aren’t the biggest fish fans (me), this fish is so tender, flaky, and well-flavored!</p>

<p>The dinner boxes work a little differently, as you don’t get as much control on what comes with the box, besides your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki and sushi or sashimi. The box comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, fried shrimp shumai, rice, and ginger dressed salad. It’s perfect for people who want to sample multiple things, which is great for people who are a little indecisive when it comes to food (me, again).</p>

<p>Another dish we’ve tried is the <strong>spicy tuna crispy rice</strong>. One of the most popular dishes in American-Japanese restaurants, Yama makes it look incredibly fancy. This dish is just a fried sushi rice “platform” topped with spicy tuna and more mayo/chives. It’s pretty simple, but it’s a dish that combines crunch with some light spice. I think it’s a great introduction for those who’ve never had raw fish!</p>

<p>I’ve been going to Yama for a few years now, and I really feel fully satisfied every time. While I can’t confirm Yama’s authenticity, as I am not Japanese myself, I can confidently say that they serve very high-quality fish that is sliced a little differently than your typical sushi restaurant. Yama is a very relaxed setting, and the portions are well-priced for the amount. If you work in the city or are just in the mood for a casual sushi lunch with quality you know you can trust, Yama is your place!</p>
