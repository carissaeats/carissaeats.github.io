        <p><p>Hey! My name is Carissa Liu (she/her), a Jersey girl who‚Äôs now calling Orlando her new home. Welcome to my food, travel, and personal blog!</p>

<p>I started being curious about my grandma‚Äôs kitchen endeavors at around 7 years old, and I turned that curiosity into having cooking show and culinary YouTube marathons. I cook with my grandma often, but bake with my sister too, which you‚Äôll see more in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>I learned that there‚Äôs a story that accompanies every bite of food. Even if you live halfway across the world from someone, it‚Äôs very likely that you‚Äôve shared similar food experiences. With cooking comes diverse stories, and living in America has allowed me to build bridges between various cultures through the wide variety of food experiences available here.</p>

<h6 id="see-some-of-the-stories-behind-my-favorite-foods-here"><a href="/stories/favoritefoods" class="nounderline">See some of the stories behind my favorite foods here.</a></h6>

<p>Food is one thing that can be transported from country to country, and because my grandma was able to bring her cooking from China, I have been able to enjoy her cooking and learn more about my own heritage by living with her.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll be releasing interviews with food establishment owners, recipes for people of all skill levels to follow, stories attached to my favorite eats, and even foodie T.V. moments. My writing is super informal, so I hope <a href="http://localhost:4000" class="nounderline">@CarissaEats</a> allows my viewers to casually enjoy food alongside me. To have healthy food on the table, let alone a positive relationship with food, is a privilege, and I do (and will) not take that for granted.</p>

<p>My <strong><a href="/beyond" class="nounderline">beyond page</a></strong> will share some destinations I‚Äôve been blessed to explore (with food as the highlight), whether it‚Äôs eating fried quail eggs in Taiwanese night markets or beignets in New Orleans.</p>

<p>In just a few months, I‚Äôll be heading out to <a href="/losangeleseats" class="nounderline">Los Angeles</a> for college. Jersey will forever have a spot spot in my heart (I always say, ‚Äúbe back soon‚Äù üíõ), but I feel lucky to be adding O-Town and LA as new hubs of my blog.</p>

<p><em>Photos on this blog are taken by me. Please do not repost my photos without my permission. My portraits are taken by Antonia (my sister, the one with the glasses in the picture above), but I‚Äôll include her food photography from time-to-time. Her food photos will always be credited!</em></p>
</p>
        <p>See you soon,</p>
        <p>Carissa üòä</p>
