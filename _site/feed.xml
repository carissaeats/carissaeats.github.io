&lt;p&gt;I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, she’s only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, I’ve been itching to try making them too. It’s month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge! Many hours later, they were far from perfect, but still the perfect homemade baked good to keep us company.

        Chicken Katsu from Mitsuwa
    &lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food represents celebration, warmth, and unity to me. At its core, food brings people together, whether it’s an excuse to catch up with old friends or just enjoying a meal with the people you love. Food helps us get through tough times, but makes the happy times even sweeter. There’s more about how I got into cooking and food on my &lt;a href=&quot;/aboutme.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt; page, but today, I’m here to share the memories attached to my favorite foods!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/beyond/china/gzcafe.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Beef Chow Fun + Char Siu Fan&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/triodumpling.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Shanghainese Trio&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gon chow ngau huo&lt;/em&gt;, or beef chow fun, is a popular Cantonese dish that’s pretty much just fresh rice noodles, which are sticky if not constantly tossed in the wok, soy sauce, thin steak, mung bean sprouts, scallions, but packs a punch of flavor in every bite. I’ve been eating this dish for as long as I can remember, yet I was not always a fan of it. My dad absolutely loves this dish, though, so it’s grown on me a ton. It tastes great with other roast meats, as seen in the char siu above too. Char siu is Cantonese honey-barbecued pork, which tastes great with plain rice or chopped in a fried rice. There are plenty of roast shops in Chinatown to buy both char siu + gon chow ngau huo, so I’ll try to compile a list of shops for the future. It’s such a cheap meal, and there’s no better food deals than Chinatowns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Shanghainese Trio”, the nickname I gave these three dishes, consists of &lt;em&gt;chong you bing&lt;/em&gt;, or scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, and &lt;em&gt;sheng jian bao&lt;/em&gt;, or pan-fried baos. I love these three dishes from Shanghai 21 (formerly Shanghai Asian Manor). I haven’t been there since it was known as the former, but their scallion pancakes are extremely crunchy and fluffy, and these baos and dumplings are stuffed with so much flavor. I can’t vouch for how these taste now, but regardless of if these dishes are made by my Grandma or at Shanghai 21, I will always keep these dishes on my favorites list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/beyond/losangeles/okonomiyaki.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        GOAM - Green Onions and Mayo
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I praised the glorious okonomiyaki on my &lt;a href=&quot;/beyond/2020/06/02/losangeles.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; post, so explore it over there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/beyond/china/cheesetea.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Mango Cheese Tea&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/beyond/hongkong/hkwaffle.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Gai Dan Jai&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheese tea, the drink phenomenon from China, is as interesting as it sounds. I hadn’t been to China since I was around 8 years old, but on my first trip to China in 2017, Antonia and I became obsessed after our first introduction to it. The “cheese” is a sweet cream cheese foam sprinkled with salt, which adds a perfect savory note to the drink. I urge you to try this should the opportunity arise, and not to let the daunting title scare you away! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heytea.com/aboutUsEn.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HeyCha&lt;/a&gt;, originally from Guangdong and pictured above, is the pioneer of cheese tea in Asia, and people wait hours upon hours to grab a cup of it. It is very, very worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gai dan jai&lt;/em&gt;, or egg waffles, are an absolute contender for favorite dessert (excluding boba or cheese tea). The egg whites folded into the batter differentiate gai dan jai from standard Belgian waffles, along with a little custard powder and tapioca starch that create a slight chewiness. I had my first traditional HK egg waffle from Lee Keung Kee North Point Egg Waffles in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, and it definitely met my expectations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wowfulls.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wowfulls&lt;/a&gt; has changed the egg waffle game in NYC, as they make egg waffle sundaes and have created pizza egg waffles in the past, so I encourage you to catch them at any upcoming popups!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/tteokbokki.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Cheese Tteokbokki
    &lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a specific memory attached to these rice cakes, other than that the first time I had them, I devoured them. Korean rice cakes smothered in gochujang (chili paste) sauce and covered in gooey mozzarella cheese. Enough said ~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/mightyquinns.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Barbecue Burnt Ends + More&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/arthurssteak.JPG&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Ribeye Steak + Caesar Salad&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These ribs, burnt ends, and brisket are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mightyquinnsbbq.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mighty Quinn’s&lt;/a&gt;. I just love burnt ends, there’s not really another explanation 😂 The steak and salad are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arthurshoboken.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arthur’s Steakhouse&lt;/a&gt; in Hoboken. Before my dad made the full time switch to working from home (like over 14 years ago), he used to eat here for coworker meals and bring leftovers home for me and my sister. We became obsessed with their garlic bread, and eventually, got to eat in the restaurant. Arthur’s makes an incredible chicken caesar salad and “Our Steak”, a 24oz marbled Rib Eye, served with Arthur’s Potatoes. This is another restaurant I remember eating at for years, so I can’t wait to return one day and bite into their sometimes burnt, nonetheless tasty, potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/becbagel.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        B.E.C. Bagel
    &lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautiful bacon, egg, and cheese bagel from Celebrity Bagels, a Tenafly staple, is one heck of special Sunday morning treat. I get mine with salt, pepper, and ketchup on an everything bagel, since I enjoy the variety of seasonings on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/tofupudding.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Tofu Pudding
    &lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really got into &lt;em&gt;dou fu hua&lt;/em&gt;, or tofu pudding, this year, when my dad and I went to Chinatown in February. This was not my first time trying it, but I was not as &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with it until then. Its primary ingredient is tofu, and although it may just seem like a bowl of soft tofu, it is really an extraordinary canvas for any condiments you like. The flavor itself is very neutral, meaning you can go either sweet or savory with it. Sweet dou fu hua is topped with a brown sugar syrup, which is how I typically eat it and is as seen above. Savory dou fu hua is topped with soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and scallions. I don’t think I’ve ever had the savory one, but it’s certainly one I’d love to try. My family likes it too, but I could eat the whole quart this pudding comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/claypotrice.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Claypot Rice&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/favoritefoods/cheesebakedrice.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Cheese-Baked Rice&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I could finish this list off by tying it back to my roots. &lt;em&gt;Bao zai fan&lt;/em&gt;, or claypot rice, and &lt;em&gt;cheese-baked rice&lt;/em&gt; are two popular Hong Kong café items. Claypot rice is typically topped with &lt;em&gt;lap cheong&lt;/em&gt;, or Chinese sausage, and &lt;em&gt;choi sum&lt;/em&gt;, or Chinese broccoli, but this one is topped with lamb chops and fried egg. We have a claypot at home, and it really makes meals special, since it sustains high temperatures. The pot browns the cooked rice, creating a nutty, toasty flavor unable to be replicated by just putting it in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheese-baked rice sounds a little odd, but everything about it works. It’s almost like a cheese pizza with a rice base. I’ve noticed a lot of Asian tomato sauces are a lot sweeter than their Italian counterparts, and the sauce on this one has a light bell pepper note as well. I’m not a fan of peppers at all, but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eat them if they’re in this rice. The cheese is almost a nod to Hong Kong’s “East Meets West” background, when HK was a Crown Colony of the British empire. My parents lived in Guangzhou, and much of my maternal extended family lives in Hong Kong today, so eating these dishes is a taste of my Hong Kong memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;both-pictures-were-taken-at-xo-kitchen-restaurant食坊-my-familys-go-to-in-manhattan-chinatown-pre-pandemic-they-make-dumplings-wrapped-in-an-ultra-thin-eggy-wrapper-that-are-a-must-try-here-too&quot;&gt;Both pictures were taken at XO Kitchen Restaurant食坊, my family’s go-to in Manhattan Chinatown pre-pandemic. They make dumplings wrapped in an ultra-thin, eggy wrapper that are a must-try here, too.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by no means an exclusive list - I have far too many foods I would consider a 20 on a 1 to 10 scale of strongly dislike to absolutely devour, so I’ll likely be updating the list in the future. I hope you enjoyed reading some of the reasons why I appreciate (and dream of) these foods a little extra.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="stories" /><summary type="html">Chicken Katsu from Mitsuwa Food represents celebration, warmth, and unity to me.

Poke (Crew)." /><published>2020-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-10-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jerseyeats/pokecrew</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jerseyeats/pokecrew">&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/pokecrew/poke.JPG&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s think Chipotle, but elevated with fresh-from-the-sea fish and so many more combinations. I discovered &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eatpokecrew.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Poke Crew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;’s grand opening through local food media company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boozyburbs.com&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boozy Burbs&lt;/a&gt;, and I don’t think I had ever been so excited for a local restaurant opening up until that point. I had always wanted to go to Hawaii, not only because of its gorgeous landscape, but because of its rich culture that I would certainly love to explore one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pronounced “poh - kay”, poke means “to slice or cut” in Hawaiian and is typically marinated meat and seafood chunks. The two creators of Poke Crew come from a Michelin-star, NYC fine-dining background, but were excited to establish this casual dining concept in Bergen County. It may not be the first poke restaurant in Bergen County, but Poke Crew is definitely one of the most popular and high-quality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Poke Crew does have pre-set bowls for people who want to make fewer decisions in a day, everything is made-to-order, so custom bowls are endlessly possible. Once you walk past the Polaroid-adorned walls, you can go to the starting line and pick-up a laminated menu, where you can then use a marker to choose the items you’d like to put in your bowl. They have so many seafood options, ranging from the popular salmon and tuna (both cubed &amp;amp; spicy tuna) to scallops, but also non-seafood options, like Berkshire pork belly, chicken teriyaki, tofu, + more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After picking your protein, you have a choice of 6 toppings, 2 sauces, and 4 garnishes. They have 20-ish toppings, 16 sauces, and 15 garnishes to choose from, so you’ll definitely have some have some decision making to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/pokecrew/morepoke.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Salmon Poke Bowl: full order below!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My typical order at Poke Crew is a white sushi rice, lettuce-based bowl with either chicken or salmon, corn, inari (sweet tofu), mango, pineapple, pickled ginger, scallion, wasabi yuzu soy, either honey pineapple mayo or yuzukoshō (fermented chili-yuzu paste) mayo, crispy shallot, candied walnut (one of my favorites), nori, and finally, everything bagel spice. Every topping adds a different dimension to the bowl. Chicken may be untraditional, but their chicken is not just a boiled or grilled chicken breast tossed with sauces. The chicken is Searzall-blowtorched for caramelization and extra flavor, making this not your average pulled chicken bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I love Poke Crew is their transformation of popular dishes, like honey walnut shrimp, to poke bowls, where they use cooked shrimp, honey pineapple mayo, and glazed walnuts. They also have an “El Taco” bowl with white tuna, sweet corn, jalapeño, chipotle mayo, tortilla, &amp;amp; more, and all of these pre-bowls can be substituted based on your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to be a seafood fan to come here. Even just trying out the tofu or chicken bowl first is a great stepping stone into opting for the seafood here. If you enjoy chains like Cava or Chipotle, there’s no reason why you won’t love Poke Crew too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jerseyeats" /><summary type="html">Let’s think Chipotle, but elevated with fresh-from-the-sea fish and so many more combinations. I discovered Poke Crew’s grand opening through local food media company, Boozy Burbs, and I don’t think I had ever been so excited for a local restaurant opening up until that point. I had always wanted to go to Hawaii, not only because of its gorgeous landscape, but because of its rich culture that I would certainly love to explore one day. Pronounced “poh - kay”, poke means “to slice or cut” in Hawaiian and is typically marinated meat and seafood chunks. The two creators of Poke Crew come from a Michelin-star, NYC fine-dining background, but were excited to establish this casual dining concept in Bergen County. It may not be the first poke restaurant in Bergen County, but Poke Crew is definitely one of the most popular and high-quality here. Although Poke Crew does have pre-set bowls for people who want to make fewer decisions in a day, everything is made-to-order, so custom bowls are endlessly possible. Once you walk past the Polaroid-adorned walls, you can go to the starting line and pick-up a laminated menu, where you can then use a marker to choose the items you’d like to put in your bowl. They have so many seafood options, ranging from the popular salmon and tuna (both cubed &amp;amp; spicy tuna) to scallops, but also non-seafood options, like Berkshire pork belly, chicken teriyaki, tofu, + more. After picking your protein, you have a choice of 6 toppings, 2 sauces, and 4 garnishes. They have 20-ish toppings, 16 sauces, and 15 garnishes to choose from, so you’ll definitely have some have some decision making to do. Salmon Poke Bowl: full order below! My typical order at Poke Crew is a white sushi rice, lettuce-based bowl with either chicken or salmon, corn, inari (sweet tofu), mango, pineapple, pickled ginger, scallion, wasabi yuzu soy, either honey pineapple mayo or yuzukoshō (fermented chili-yuzu paste) mayo, crispy shallot, candied walnut (one of my favorites), nori, and finally, everything bagel spice. Every topping adds a different dimension to the bowl. Chicken may be untraditional, but their chicken is not just a boiled or grilled chicken breast tossed with sauces. The chicken is Searzall-blowtorched for caramelization and extra flavor, making this not your average pulled chicken bowl. Another reason I love Poke Crew is their transformation of popular dishes, like honey walnut shrimp, to poke bowls, where they use cooked shrimp, honey pineapple mayo, and glazed walnuts. They also have an “El Taco” bowl with white tuna, sweet corn, jalapeño, chipotle mayo, tortilla, &amp;amp; more, and all of these pre-bowls can be substituted based on your preferences. You don’t have to be a seafood fan to come here. Even just trying out the tofu or chicken bowl first is a great stepping stone into opting for the seafood here. If you enjoy chains like Cava or Chipotle, there’s no reason why you won’t love Poke Crew too!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;apologies-for-all-the-cringey-cheese-puns-on-the-way&quot;&gt;Apologies for all the cringey cheese puns on the way…&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Brazilian cheese bread, &lt;strong&gt;pão de queijo&lt;/strong&gt;, this naturally gluten-free tapioca cheese bread is not what you might first think of when you hear “bread”, but its airiness, chewiness, and exterior crunchiness will be sure to win over even the most passionate bread purists. I want to preface this by saying this cheese bread is by no means authentic or traditional, but it still contains the two basic ingredients of cheese and tapioca flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;brazilian-cheese-bread-history-according-to-eater-the-first-instance-of-pão-de-queijo-was-likely-produced-with-the-tapioca-starch-17th-century-slave-communities-collected-during-the-processing-of-cassava-plants-to-supplement-their-meager-daily-rations-but-cheese-wasnt-incorporated-until-the-beginning-of-the-20th-century&quot;&gt;Brazilian Cheese Bread History: According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2016/8/8/12402578/pao-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-gluten-free&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eater&lt;/a&gt;, the first instance of pão de queijo was likely produced with the tapioca starch 17th-century slave communities collected “during the processing of cassava plants to supplement their meager daily rations”, but cheese wasn’t incorporated until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recipe is as simple as it gets for bread. As long as you have tapioca flour, the other ingredients are very likely already in your pantry/fridge. I adapted this recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/98554/brazilian-cheese-bread-pao-de-queijo/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Allrecipes.com&lt;/a&gt;, whose second step requires a saucepan to boil the liquid ingredients together, but a microwave to melt the butter did the trick for me. After that, it’s just a progression of dumping ingredients into a bowl and pouring the batter into a muffin tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend using a Pyrex liquid measuring cup to do all your mixing in, as it makes pouring into a muffin tin even easier, but a regular mixing bowl and spoon will do the job as well. The recipe I adapted mine from implies that the mixture should be solid enough to drop small balls of it onto a sheet pan, but mine comes out as a thicker-than-cake batter. Regardless, I’ve never had a time where I didn’t absolutely devour these bread bites, so I’m doing something right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick 18 minutes in the oven later, and you’ll find a toasted cheese aroma circulating through your kitchen. The golden-brown tops will let you know that they’re ready to go - the inside may be &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; underbaked, but there should be no liquid left whatsoever. This cheese bread is incredibly addictive - I make them to “share” with my dad, but once I start, I can’t hold myself back from eating more, which my grandma gets very upset about when I need to eat dinner in the next 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve been perfectly shaped by the muffin mold the past two times I’ve made these, but even if they come out with a hole on the bottom, I promise they’re still DELICIOUS! I used too much butter the first couple times, which is partly why the ones below are more golden (no complaints there). You can see the difference in the photos below. Plus, you can use the hole as a vehicle for any condiments you might want to add.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s get on with the recipe and &lt;em&gt;cheese&lt;/em&gt; the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tapioca-cheese-bread&quot;&gt;Tapioca Cheese Bread&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;yields-12-breads-in-a-mini-muffin-tin&quot;&gt;Yields 12 breads in a mini muffin tin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup tapioca flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons warm melted butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⅓ cup milk or soy milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⅓ cup grated Parmesan or gouda cheese (more or less, based on your preferred cheesiness)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 beaten egg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;½ teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;⅛ teaspoon of granulated garlic (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat your oven to 375°F, or 190°C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combine milk, warm melted butter, beaten egg, and salt.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be sure to thoroughly mix, as you do not want the egg to cook at all.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir in the tapioca flour in two parts and mix until smooth.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Luckily, you don’t have to worry about overmixing as you would with regular bread, since there’s no gluten in this recipe!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Combining tapioca flour and liquids can create a slimy texture, so you may struggle to mix at first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the cheese of your choice and stir well.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I’ve only tried Parmesan and gouda, but any lower-moisture cheeses would definitely work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill each mold basically full, but not to the point where any batter spreads out of the individual cup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake until the tops are lightly golden brown for 15-20 minutes. Aren’t they &lt;em&gt;cheesy&lt;/em&gt; on the eyes?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Because of the butter and oils from the cheese, the breads should come right out of a non-stick muffin tray.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with honey, jam, or marinara sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pinklady Cheese Tart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be unfamiliar with the Hokkaido cheese tarts that Pinklady is inspired by. Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island, has a massive countryside that can support a successful dairy industry. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5312.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;japan-guide.com&lt;/a&gt;, the island produce’s half of Japan’s milk, and their dairy products are highly regarded across the country. The tarts supposedly originated in a bakery in Hokkaido’s capital of Sapporo, obviously using those quality dairy products. Hokkaido is one of my top bucket-list destinations, not only for the food, but for the nature (flowers, volcanoes, etc.), hot springs, skiing, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cheese tarts should not be confused with the popular Hong Kong egg tarts or Portuguese/Macanese pastéis de nata, as those tarts are filled with a silky sweet custard, while cheese tarts are made with oozy cheese mousse. The crusts on the other two are typically puff pastry-like, while cheese tart shells are more comparable to a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;fun-fact-these-tarts-typically-contain-three-types-of-cheese-cream-cheese-mascarpone-cheese-and-the-most-surprising-one-parmesan-cheese-the-parmesan-does-not-make-these-tarts-savory---i-think-that-a-small-amount-adds-slight-saltiness-and-nuttiness-that-balances-the-sweetness-of-this-dessert&quot;&gt;Fun fact: these tarts typically contain THREE types of cheese: cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and the most surprising one, parmesan cheese! The parmesan does NOT make these tarts savory - I think that a small amount adds slight saltiness and nuttiness that balances the sweetness of this dessert.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first experience with a cheese tart was in Taiwan, where I tried a boba-filled one - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. Although the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese itself that really stood out. Since then, I’ve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me. When I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmiUUdHTPM/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jeaniuseats/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@jeaniuseats&lt;/a&gt;, I was ECSTATIC!! The location of Pinklady was perfect, as my dad and I stop by Mott Street almost monthly, so I made it a target stop on our next trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinklady may not be the first cheese tart in Manhattan, but they are one of the only NYC businesses really specializing in cheese tarts. They only sell two products, one being their array of tarts, and the other being their housemade rice yogurt drinks, which I’ve heard lovely things about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store’s giant yellow sign sticks out like a sore thumb on Chinatown’s “unofficial Main Street” that’s decorated with the lucky Chinese color of red all over. There’s no seating inside, which I wouldn’t expect to change after the pandemic, given the store’s small space. There’s a few back-of-the-house staff, but it’s been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times I’ve been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, which is not always an easy find at bakeries and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entrance, you’ll see that there are “sneeze guard” dividers to protect the tarts from any customers (who must wear a mask inside too), and the tarts are lined up on Silpats and plastic trays. They currently offer five flavors of &lt;strong&gt;original cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;matcha&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ube&lt;/strong&gt; (purple yam), &lt;strong&gt;chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;strawberry-filled chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve tried all but the chocolate one, since I’m not the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; fan of chocolate (I’m prepared to get some hate mail…). My favorite is the matcha, because the matcha accompanies the cheese perfectly, but you really can’t go wrong with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Inside of the Matcha Cheese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, about those temperatures I was talking about, there are four ways to enjoy these tarts. It’s almost like four different dessert types that range from firm + cheesecake-like to molten lava tarts. Putting the tart in the fridge will make the flowy inside firm up like a cheesecake, while putting it in the oven / air-fryer will make the inside hot and ooze of lava cheese. The other two ways are the most similar, which are just warming the tarts up in the microwave and eating it plain-Jane room temperature. My personal favorite is room-temperature, because I still get a slightly flowy inside while the tart retains a cheesecake-esque texture on the outer parts of the filling, but even just the versatility of how this dessert can be consumed is so unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do love myself a flaky HK egg tart crust, Pinklady double bakes their tart shells, making for a crispier, slightly toasted tartlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was beyond satisfied with my stop at Pinklady. My dad and I fought over the last cheese tart, because they’re just that good (we ended up splitting it). Opening at the peak of the pandemic in April is no easy feat, and although there are many old staples in Chinatown that deserve an equal amount of appreciation, Pinklady is a great addition to an already fantastic, robust neighborhood dessert scene. Be sure to pay a visit at your next stop in Chinatown!&lt;/p&gt;

The basement-esque location we go to now is different than the one he used to go to, but he says this one is just as good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad loves to eat fish, especially sashimi, and even though I’m really not a big fan of fish, I do like sashimi and sushi. I hope that I’ll be able to explore Japan one day to try authentic food, but for now, Yama serves high-quality, thinly sliced sashimi fish that keeps my family super happy. The “&lt;strong&gt;sashimi entree&lt;/strong&gt;” of assorted sashimi is my dad’s favorite meal to eat. The sashimi is sliced thinner than a lot of sushi restaurants do, with pieces that are longer too. They are served on top of perilla leaves that are a perfect palate cleanser, and eating rice in between slices is recommended too. I wish I could tell you the types of fish in this selection, but I can definitely say there’s salmon and tuna (sorry!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Sashimi Entree!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my sister and dad get the sashimi entree, I opt for a &lt;strong&gt;hot dish-sushi combo bento box&lt;/strong&gt;. A bento is simply a box of an assortment of rice/noodles, meat, &amp;amp; vegetables that’s very popular throughout East Asia. The photo at the very top is the lunch version, where you can choose 2 entrees out of many options, such as tonkatsu, ginger pork, tempura, sushi, hamachi kama, just to name a few. I love their chicken karaage, and even though I haven’t had a huge amount of karaage, this is my personal favorite! I also get their sushi, which is nigiri-style, which is just a slice of raw fish over sushi rice. I have noticed that the raw fish used on the sushi is warmer and not as high-quality as the sashimi alone, but it’s still great. The steam from the rice does wlightly warm the raw fish a bit, so it’s not the very chilled temperature that the sashimi retains. The box is accompanied with fresh orange slices and broiled fish - even for those aren’t the biggest fish fans (me), this fish is so tender, flaky, and well-flavored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner boxes work a little differently, as you don’t get as much control on what comes with the box, besides your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki and sushi or sashimi. The box comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, fried shrimp shumai, rice, and ginger dressed salad. It’s perfect for people who want to sample multiple things, which is great for people who are a little indecisive when it comes to food (me, again).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish we’ve tried is the &lt;strong&gt;spicy tuna crispy rice&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the most popular dishes in American-Japanese restaurants, Yama makes it look incredibly fancy. This dish is just a fried sushi rice “platform” topped with spicy tuna and more mayo/chives. It’s pretty simple, but it’s a dish that combines crunch with some light spice. I think it’s a great introduction to those who’ve never had raw fish!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/yamasushi/crispyrice.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been going to Yama for a few years now, and I really feel fully satisfied every time. Japanese food is something that can be so excited, and while I’m not sure that Yama is super authentic, I can confidently say that they serve very high-quality fish that is sliced a little differently than your typical sushi restaurant. Yama is a very relaxed setting, and the portions are well-priced for the amount. If you work in the city or are just in the mood for a casual sushi lunch with quality you know you can trust, Yama is your place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://taiyakinyc.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taiyaki NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is known for their Japanese fish-shaped cones filled with soft serve ice cream. The texture of the cones are a little bit like waffles, but so much better. Traditionally, they’re stuffed with anko, or sweet red azuki bean paste, but Taiyaki offers them with custard filling too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…BUT! Today, we’re talking about their fluffy pancakes! Although they’ve been popular in Japan for a while now, fluffy pancakes have just started making their splash in New York City. It’s really no surprise that these pancakes are gaining so much popularity - their taller-than-average height and jiggly movement make for a fun dish to eat. This is achieved through separating the egg yolks from the egg whites, the latter of which is beaten until stiff peaks are attained. This meringue is gently folded into the batter, which makes these pancakes extra fluffy because of the air bubbles formed during this process. However, these pancakes are so much more than their stunning appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked that these pancakes were just as tasty as how stunning they looked. Given that a good part of the batter is that meringue, my initial expectation was that it would mostly taste of egg whites. I really was surprised by the great balance in taste - they have a really subtle, but just strong enough, sweetness, custard-y taste, and slight browning on the outside. Since I don’t like my desserts too sweet, these pancakes really were everything I wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/pancake/fluffywhite.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiyaki NYC offers these pancakes in two ways. The pancakes I tried were topped with a soft matcha cream sauce and a crispy mini anko-filled taiyaki, and served with a side of whipped cream, but you can also get them your classic style with a pat of butter, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and a side of syrup. Since these pancakes are just so good on their own, either way will taste absolutely fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about these pancakes that were taking NYC by storm through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taiyakinyc&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@taiyakinyc&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram and was incredibly excited to try them out, but Taiyaki NYC only sells these cakes from Fridays to Sundays, 11am-2pm at their Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Boston locations for now, to ensure that their product is quality-controlled. So, my first soufflé pancake experience was actually at the Smorgasburg Outdoor Food Market that takes place from late March to October in Williamsburg. A stand, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Fluffysnyc/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluffy’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was a new vendor for the 2019 season that specializes in soufflé pancakes. The only difference I could find was that Fluffy’s pancakes were slightly undercooked, which you even might be able to notice in the photo below. This is probably due to the overwhelming lines at their stand - Fluffy’s was undoubtedly one of the most popular vendors at the market. Fluffy’s also offers a lot more variety in flavors offered, including blueberry cheesecake (pictured below), crème brûlée (yes, sounds incredible!), Nutella, and a rotating vegan option too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Blueberry Cheesecake Pancakes&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever you find your fluffy soufflé pancakes, I have no doubt that you’ll enjoy them. From what I’ve seen, a reasonable &lt;em&gt;New York City&lt;/em&gt; price for about 2 pancakes will run ~$10-$12. I’ve seen some places run their prices up to $20 for two, not so tall, fluffy pancakes, which I can’t justify buying whatsoever. Taiyaki NYC makes an absolutely fantastic pancake, as does Fluffy’s *, and I highly recommend that if the time (Fridays-Sundays, 11am-2pm) and price work for you, have these pancakes as a really lovely end-of-the-week treat 🥞.&lt;/p&gt;

        Pork Belly, Bistro Hanger Steak, Spicy Pork, and Assorted Veggie Packet
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 700 locations world wide, the global franchise restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku, is definitely not unique to NYC, but I do live close to the city, so Manhattan is the most accessible place for me to enjoy their Japanese barbecue. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gyu-kaku.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restaurant’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the name, Gyu-Kaku, means “Horn of the Bull” in Japanese. The chain strives to replicate an authentic yakiniku, or grilled meat barbecue, dining experience that isn’t so easy to find outside of Japan. Although I’ve never been to Japan, what matters is that Gyu-Kaku still serves high-quality dishes prepared with lots of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real charm about this place is how worth it the food is, ESPECIALLY if you go during their “Happy Hour”, where they offer many dishes at a discounted price (GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!!). You get so much food for a reasonable price, making this one of my all-time favorite meals. I leave feeling so whole-hearted every time without my dad needing to spend way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Gyu-Kaku, yakiniku is grill-it-yourself! You can &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; think about it like Korean BBQ, but the taste is REALLY quite different from Korean barbecue. However, if you like KBBQ, I have no doubts that you’ll LOVE yakinuku! They are both very unique dining experiences, as in my opinion, a Korean BBQ meal is only complete with a large set of banchan side dishes, such as your typical kimchi, Kongnamul bean sprouts, mung bean jelly, among MANY, many others (I am by no means an expert on either KBBQ or yakiniku, so I’m sure I’m missing a lot) that are meant to be enjoyed alongside the meal, whereas yakiniku can be enjoyed with simpler accompaniments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/gyukakulayout.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The Layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first order of business: the meat! They offer TONS of different types of meat, such as chicken, duck, pork belly, salmon, BBQ calamari, Japanese-style pork sausage, and of course, beef. I would say the stars of the show are the beef preparations, however, as their beef options range from classic thin beef tongue to premium USDA Prime kalbi short ribs. You can choose from meat marinated in their signature marinades* OR just naked meat with some salt + pepper - you can’t go wrong with either!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;-all-of-their-sauces--marinades-are-gluten-free&quot;&gt;* All of their sauces + marinades are gluten-free!!&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite meat (beef) options are the garlic-marinated bistro hanger steak, ultra-thin, super-fatty toro beef, and of course for a treat, the kalbi short ribs marinated in sweet soy tare. Those might be my favorites, but ANY of their meat options, beyond just beef, are absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the sauce bottle trio on the side of your table!! The best sauce is the combo of all three, ponzu, sweet soy, and “spicy”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that as a yakiniku restaurant, the premise behind the whole place is their grilled meat. But the things that keep me coming back are their incredible plates of cooked dishes that make you feel so cozy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been coming to Gyu-Kaku for as long as I can remember. My mom used to work in the city, and this spot was a favorite among her and her coworkers. When my sister and I were first introduced, we couldn’t stop coming back!! So this place really brings back a lot of fond memories that make my heart warm every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/garlicnoodles.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Is your mouth watering yet?!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dish that I’d like to talk about is their &lt;strong&gt;garlic noodles&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me tell you, if Gyu-Kaku ONLY sold these noodles, I’d be okay with it. This is the first dish I ever ate Gyu-Kaku, and I’ve loved them for as long as I can remember. The dish is made with thick, udon-style, egg noodles that are coated in a slightly sweetened garlic sauce and vegetables. You have the choice of ground chicken, vegetables, or shrimp. They’re served on a cast-iron plate, which slightly browns the outsides of the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/tunariceportrait.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The &quot;Volcano&quot;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish I love is their absolutely non-traditional, but no less mouthwatering, &lt;strong&gt;spicy tuna volcano&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s a crispy fried block of rice topped with spicy tuna over a layer of Japanese shoyu BBQ sauce. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two dishes are some of their best-sellers, and it’s not difficult to see why. These might be my two favorites, but not far behind (at all) are any of their &lt;strong&gt;bibimbap rice dishes&lt;/strong&gt; that achieve glorious browning from their hot stone bowls and their &lt;strong&gt;tuna poke nachos&lt;/strong&gt; - something about a fried wonton skin just feels right, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Tuna Poke Nachos&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyu-Kaku will forever have a special place in my heart, as it has been since I was young. This restaurant chain makes food that is so effortlessly comforting and tasty. I can confidently say that I’ve never had a bad dish from here, despite the overwhelmingly large menu. Even though the place isn’t catered towards vegetarians, they make some great grilled veggies (with or without a touch of butter), of which I recommend the corn, and salads too. If you aren’t stuffed by the end, they also serve great desserts, like crêpe cake slices from Lady M and chocolate lava cakes, of which I’ve included photos below. I highly recommmend this place for any and all occasions, as they serve well-priced food that leaves you feeling happier than a traditional “5-star” meal would.&lt;/p&gt;

Those might be my favorites, but ANY of their meat options, beyond just beef, are absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the sauce bottle trio on the side of your table!! The best sauce is the combo of all three, ponzu, sweet soy, and “spicy”. I know that as a yakiniku restaurant, the premise behind the whole place is their grilled meat. But the things that keep me coming back are their incredible plates of cooked dishes that make you feel so cozy inside. I’ve been coming to Gyu-Kaku for as long as I can remember. My mom used to work in the city, and this spot was a favorite among her and her coworkers. When my sister and I were first introduced, we couldn’t stop coming back!! So this place really brings back a lot of fond memories that make my heart warm every time. Is your mouth watering yet?! The first dish that I’d like to talk about is their garlic noodles. Let me tell you, if Gyu-Kaku ONLY sold these noodles, I’d be okay with it. This is the first dish I ever ate Gyu-Kaku, and I’ve loved them for as long as I can remember. The dish is made with thick, udon-style, egg noodles that are coated in a slightly sweetened garlic sauce and vegetables. You have the choice of ground chicken, vegetables, or shrimp. They’re served on a cast-iron plate, which slightly browns the outsides of the noodles. The &quot;Volcano&quot;! Another dish I love is their absolutely non-traditional, but no less mouthwatering, spicy tuna volcano. It’s a crispy fried block of rice topped with spicy tuna over a layer of Japanese shoyu BBQ sauce. Enough said. These two dishes are some of their best-sellers, and it’s not difficult to see why. These might be my two favorites, but not far behind (at all) are any of their bibimbap rice dishes that achieve glorious browning from their hot stone bowls and their tuna poke nachos - something about a fried wonton skin just feels right, you know? Tuna Poke Nachos Gyu-Kaku will forever have a special place in my heart, as it has been since I was young. This restaurant chain makes food that is so effortlessly comforting and tasty. I can confidently say that I’ve never had a bad dish from here, despite the overwhelmingly large menu. Even though the place isn’t catered towards vegetarians, they make some great grilled veggies (with or without a touch of butter), of which I recommend the corn, and salads too. If you aren’t stuffed by the end, they also serve great desserts, like crêpe cake slices from Lady M and chocolate lava cakes, of which I’ve included photos below. I highly recommmend this place for any and all occasions, as they serve well-priced food that leaves you feeling happier than a traditional “5-star” meal would. Note: Just to clarify, these photos are from several different times I’ve eaten at Gyu-Kaku over the years.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Seattle</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seattle" /><published>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle">&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to one of my favorite cities!! 😊 While it’s known for the constant rain, the Seattle summer weather is absolutely perfect - mid-70s, shining sun until 9PM, and minimal rain. What you wouldn’t expect, though, are the unique attractions, beautiful landscape, and some of the best food you’ll find around! See all the places I went below…&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but first, dessert - who said dessert can't come first?! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Molly Moon's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of Seattle's most popular ice cream shops, was the first on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to their website, their &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/flavors&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Yeti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ice cream flavor is their signature sweet cream ice cream, but swirled with vanilla bean caramel and &quot;yeti&quot; granola, which are both made in-house, along with Theo chocolate bits. They make the creamiest ice cream, and knowing that everything is sourced locally, with no artificial additives, makes this ice cream even more lovable!!&lt;/p&gt;

This restaurant is one of my favorites from Asia, as my dad introduced it to me on our trip to China in 2018. I had always been a fan of xiaolongbao, but there's something so special about the way DTF prepares their ultra-thin wrappers and piping hot soup inside. While DTF is pricy for xiaolongbao, many will agree that indulging in these small dumplings of heaven are worth it. Please, DTF, come to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got just the plain Kurobata pork soup dumplings (the cheapest XLB option), but they also sell crab + pork ones that are my favorite kind. DTF also serves an even more indulgent option - the truffle Kurobata pork ones. If you love the unique taste of truffle, these are definitely for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Known for their breakfast bar, customers that order off the &quot;breakfast bar&quot; section are able to top their meal off with a &quot;selection of seasonal fruit, nuts, &amp;amp; whipped cream&quot;. I ordered the bananas foster french toast and topped it off with their fresh strawberries - so apPEELing 😋&lt;/p&gt;

Their original cake, which was first served back in 2008, the Dark Decadence, is crafted with Theo chocolate, dry-burned caramel, nib toffee, + vanilla ice cream. They pride themselves on their dry-burned caramel, which takes long periods of intense concentration and patience (you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://getyourhotcakes.com/pages/dry-burned-caramel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF ANGELS! Having lived in the same place my whole life on the East Coast, I had always been interested in life on the West Coast. New York City is a very fast city - everyone is always on the move and in a rush. Los Angeles is what some might consider NYC’s polar opposite. As die-hard New Yorkers say, if the only thing you can say about your city is that the weather is good, the city &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; just isn’t that good. SoCal is known for its warmer weather throughout the year, but there’s so much more to this wonderful city than just the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L.A. goes at a slower pace than NYC, giving it a more relaxed feel. But, with both cities, there are great things and some not-so-fantastic things. NYC is a city made to be explored through public transportation and by foot, especially given Manhattan’s smart grid design. You pretty much &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a car to get around, which means the notorious L.A. traffic. However, my sister says the public transportation isn’t as terrible as people say it is, but…NYC definitely wins in that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the two, my winner is… actually L.A.!! Many will disagree, but L.A. is such an inviting, exciting city that has endless free activities to enjoy and a food scene that I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; love more. Don’t get me wrong, NYC is an absolute food paradise, but I guess my taste buds are just happier in the L.A. sunshine ☀️. Also, my mom spent a few years in California when she first immigrated to the U.S., so maybe it’s just in my blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my older sister, Antonia, actually goes to college in the L.A. area, so for Thanksgiving 2018, my dad and I went to spend time with her. We were only able to explore L.A. for about three days, so we didn’t get to see a whole lot, but that can be a good thing - L.A. keeps me coming back for more, and that means that I have something to look forward to the next time I return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the places I ate and visited during my Thanksgiving trip!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
    Eating at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinchikurin-usa.com/menu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;
    Chinchikurin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was my first time trying okonomiyaki. Since then, this dish has been 
    one of my all-time favorites! They serve Hiroshima okonomiyaki, which is one of 
    two main styles of okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake with okonomi- meaning 
    &quot;as you like&quot; and -yaki meaning &quot;cooked&quot;. Osaka style is a batter with all ingredients being 
    mixed inside, whereas each ingredient in the Hiroshima style is separated into its own layer, 
    allowing each layer to provide its own unique taste + texture. There's typically 11 (WOW!) layers, 
    with grilled noodles, vegetables, crepe-like batter, meat, and many more. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinchikurin offers 9 ways to eat your Hiroshima okonomiyaki, and each way has its 
    own specific toppings. My family tried 3 ways, as each pancake can be eaten as a single portion. 
    We shared the GOAM (pictured above), which is green onions and mayo, the B&amp;amp;C, or the basil &amp;amp; 
    cheese, and the Chinchikurinyaki, which has the shioburiyaki ground beef mixture inside. All 
    okonomiyakis served have &quot;The Classic&quot; 
    as their base, which can be ordered plain without toppings. However, the toppings make these pancakes 
    even more exciting! It's such a fun experience to eat here, as you're able to use the &quot;hera&quot; (miniature spatula) 
    to cut into the okonomiyaki that's sitting utop a heated grill. Get the B&amp;amp;C if you like cheese - it was my favorite!! 
    Chinchikurin also has a takoyaki window if you just want a quick snack walking through Little Tokyo! I absolutely love 
    this place.

        I am a big fan of Buzzfeed's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vtqDuUM1DmXwYYAQcyUwtcalp_SesZD&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Worth It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series, a show that compares a food dish at three different price points to determine which one is the most worth it for its price, hosted by Steven Lim and Andrew Ilnyckyj. For their steak episode, the one at the lowest price point of $12 was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unclejohnsdtla.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Uncle John's Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'s steak and eggs dish. Uncle John's is an American-Chinese diner that serves up your favorite diner classics, like hot cakes and French toast, but also mixing up your egg dishes with chashu BBQ pork and honey garlic chicken wings. It's like a super fun, diner-centric American-Chinese takeout restaurant. Obviously, I had to try the affordable steak that was greatly loved by both Steven and Andrew!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I tried their famous $12 steak and eggs * that's served with your choice of side and toast. I chose mine to go with fried rice, white toast, and sunny-side up eggs, and boy, these portions are HUGE - TOTALLY WORTH IT! The fried rice was very plain, as it seemed like it was only tossed in soy sauce and scallions. The eggs were just how I liked them, with some slight browning on the edges and runny yolks. The steak was a bit chewier, but it was cooked to a great temperature and well-seasoned. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The real star of Uncle John's is the spicy pork chops. They're lightly fried and really pack a punch of flavor. The chops have a slight kick, but are also really well-seasoned. My dad got the pork chops with a side of chow mein, which we all really enjoyed. I'd say that this place is a great place if you're looking for a cheap meal with a whole lot of food. Uncle John's also trades in their diner classics for Cajun seafood at night, which I will definitely be trying the next time I come back to visit!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;
    * &lt;em&gt;The price of the steak and eggs has slowly gone up due to the increasing popularity, so I've seen on Yelp that
        it's now around $14. 
    &lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I know Hollywood is pretty much a place that most locals want to avoid, but I was on a mission to find a good steakhouse! After doing some light research, I stumbled upon &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mussoandfrankgrill.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood since its opening in 1919. The restaurant has an extensive menu that covers all your favorite steakhouse classics and is also super old-school and is pretty dark-lit. When my family eats steak, we like to eat ribeye, so we got one bone-in and one boneless. Both had very defined grill marks and were each very flavorful, but sadly, the portions were really small for the price, which was disappointing. We also got the French-cut lamb chops, which paired well with the mint jelly on the side. We also got some sauteed onions and mac &amp;amp; cheese, which are my go-to steakhouse sides. Overall, I really did enjoy the meal and loved the setting that gives you an idea of what it was like 100 years ago, but the portions were smaller than expected. I would recommend Musso &amp;amp; Frank as one to try if you're in Hollywood!

My dad and sister ordered the chef's choice sashimi lunch, which I was able to try and see how fresh the fish was. We also tried the kurobota pork ginger, which definitely had a more subtle flavor. The pork worked really well with the slaw on the side and is a dish that I definitely recommend! I also had the salmon lover roll, which had fresh AND cooked salmon incorporated into the roll - the name itself should tell you that this roll is for salmon lovers!! Osawa also has shabu counter, which my sister indulges in for special occasions. I look forward to being able to try that in the future!

SoCal locations and is famous for their MilkyBun, a warm donut stuffed with ice cream and toppings of your choice. I don't believe that Afters is a franchise, so all locations are quality-controlled and should be consistent. The Pasadena location is styled as a gas-station and gives off a retro feeling that oddly fits so well with ice cream. My dad always gets a triple scoop that the three of us split, as it's a lot cheaper to get a triple scoop than three individual singles. We tried their Jasmine milk tea, cookie butter, and Vietnamese coffee flavors, which were happy to find that their tastes matched their names. Afters doesn't use artificial flavorings, so each taste was true to their promised flavors. We also tried their MilkyBun, which was just as good as a donut-ice cream pair sounds (amazing 😋).

            Brown Sugar Boba
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Something remarkable to me is how bubble tea shops in L.A. are not just the regular global franchises, like Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, CoCo, etc., but rather smaller localized chains or mom and pop shops. On the East Coast, bubble tea shops are almost purely these chains, with very few small businesses completely specializing in bubble tea. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onezo.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;OneZo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has expanded more, even opening up a location in Manhattan, but OneZo is unique as it creates its boba pearls from scratch, meaning there are no additives or artificial flavorings. They're able to control the product from start to finish, which makes you feel a little bit better about drinking bubble tea. They claim to be the world's first bubble tea brand to serve made-in-house fresh boba, which is certainly difficult to find. I got the brown sugar boba milk, which had perfectly chewy tapioca pearls coated in a sticky brown sugar mixture. This place has many locations throughout California and is slowly making its way throughout the U.S.. OneZo is an absolute MUST-TRY!

This is one of my sister's favorite spots to get boba tea, so she took us to the San Gabriel location when visiting. Immediately upon arrival, we noticed that the place was bustling with people. There were people playing board games and just sitting on the couch, and this was around 9:30PM! We ordered our drinks, which took about 10 minutes to prepare, but the wait was worth it! The boba pearls were as chewy as we liked. FTB also serves classic Asian snack foods, like popcorn chicken, fried gyoza, sweet potato fries, &amp;amp; more, and they also have an extensive drink menu with lots of topping options.

The bell was donated by the Republic of Korea in 1976 to signify the strong friendship between the U.S. and Korea, as well as to honor the Korean War Veterans. The patterns of the bell are modeled after the Bronze Bell of King Songdok that was built in 771 A.D. and is still on display today. The pavilion was stunning, as you are able to go up close and see the intricate design of the bell. It is set with a background view of Long Beach, and you are even able to see Los Angeles from afar. It is a little bit of a drive from Downtown L.A. but it is a must-see in my opinion!

        This is really the high-rise, typical city part of L.A., where you can find art galleries, markets, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and lots more. Because of our limited time there, we really just window-shopped, &quot;people watched&quot;, walked through the Japanese Village Plaza, and checked out Little Tokyo. There are endless things to find in DTLA, as it has great wall art and lots of areas to do some light flea-market shopping + walking.

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the time, we did some sightseeing, like seeing the Queen Mary Ship, a cruise ship that my dad and sister went on about 15 years ago, as well as visiting the Museum of Selfies, seeing Antonia’s school, and exploring Pasadena and its surrounding areas. We definitely had a packed 3 days, where we enjoyed some of the best food and saw a few beautiful sights in L.A.. I cannot wait till my next time in L.A., because I clearly have lots more to see in what this huge city has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

Having lived in the same place my whole life on the East Coast, I had always been interested in life on the West Coast. New York City is a very fast city - everyone is always on the move and in a rush. Los Angeles is what some might consider NYC’s polar opposite. As die-hard New Yorkers say, if the only thing you can say about your city is that the weather is good, the city probably just isn’t that good. SoCal is known for its warmer weather throughout the year, but there’s so much more to this wonderful city than just the weather. L.A. goes at a slower pace than NYC, giving it a more relaxed feel. But, with both cities, there are great things and some not-so-fantastic things. NYC is a city made to be explored through public transportation and by foot, especially given Manhattan’s smart grid design. You pretty much need a car to get around, which means the notorious L.A. traffic. However, my sister says the public transportation isn’t as terrible as people say it is, but…NYC definitely wins in that one. Between the two, my winner is… actually L.A.!! Many will disagree, but L.A. is such an inviting, exciting city that has endless free activities to enjoy and a food scene that I personally love more. Don’t get me wrong, NYC is an absolute food paradise, but I guess my taste buds are just happier in the L.A. sunshine ☀️. Also, my mom spent a few years in California when she first immigrated to the U.S., so maybe it’s just in my blood? So my older sister, Antonia, actually goes to college in the L.A. area, so for Thanksgiving 2018, my dad and I went to spend time with her. We were only able to explore L.A. for about three days, so we didn’t get to see a whole lot, but that can be a good thing - L.A. keeps me coming back for more, and that means that I have something to look forward to the next time I return. Check out the places I ate and visited during my Thanksgiving trip! We went all over L.A. metro area, including San Gabriel Valley, Long Beach, Hollywood, Little Tokyo, and more, so it’ll definitely be a drive around!

Uncle John's also trades in their diner classics for Cajun seafood at night, which I will definitely be trying the next time I come back to visit! * The price of the steak and eggs has slowly gone up due to the increasing popularity, so I've seen on Yelp that it's now around $14. Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill Ribeyes, Mac &amp;amp; Cheese, Lamb Chops, Sauteed Onions I know Hollywood is pretty much a place that most locals want to avoid, but I was on a mission to find a good steakhouse! After doing some light research, I stumbled upon Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood since its opening in 1919. The restaurant has an extensive menu that covers all your favorite steakhouse classics and is also super old-school and is pretty dark-lit. When my family eats steak, we like to eat ribeye, so we got one bone-in and one boneless. Both had very defined grill marks and were each very flavorful, but sadly, the portions were really small for the price, which was disappointing. We also got the French-cut lamb chops, which paired well with the mint jelly on the side. We also got some sauteed onions and mac &amp;amp; cheese, which are my go-to steakhouse sides. Overall, I really did enjoy the meal and loved the setting that gives you an idea of what it was like 100 years ago, but the portions were smaller than expected. I would recommend Musso &amp;amp; Frank as one to try if you're in Hollywood! Osawa Pasadena Salmon Lover Sushi Roll Osawa Pasadena is an authentic Japanese restaurant in Pasadena that not only serves up your standard sushi and sashimi, but also hot dishes that aren't frequently seen in Japanese restaurants across America. My dad and sister ordered the chef's choice sashimi lunch, which I was able to try and see how fresh the fish was. We also tried the kurobota pork ginger, which definitely had a more subtle flavor. The pork worked really well with the slaw on the side and is a dish that I definitely recommend! I also had the salmon lover roll, which had fresh AND cooked salmon incorporated into the roll - the name itself should tell you that this roll is for salmon lovers!! Osawa also has shabu counter, which my sister indulges in for special occasions. I look forward to being able to try that in the future! Afters Ice Cream Triple Scoop! Afters Ice Cream has 27 (and counting!) SoCal locations and is famous for their MilkyBun, a warm donut stuffed with ice cream and toppings of your choice. I don't believe that Afters is a franchise, so all locations are quality-controlled and should be consistent. The Pasadena location is styled as a gas-station and gives off a retro feeling that oddly fits so well with ice cream. My dad always gets a triple scoop that the three of us split, as it's a lot cheaper to get a triple scoop than three individual singles. We tried their Jasmine milk tea, cookie butter, and Vietnamese coffee flavors, which were happy to find that their tastes matched their names. Afters doesn't use artificial flavorings, so each taste was true to their promised flavors. We also tried their MilkyBun, which was just as good as a donut-ice cream pair sounds (amazing 😋). OneZo Brown Sugar Boba Something remarkable to me is how bubble tea shops in L.A. are not just the regular global franchises, like Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, CoCo, etc., but rather smaller localized chains or mom and pop shops. On the East Coast, bubble tea shops are almost purely these chains, with very few small businesses completely specializing in bubble tea. OneZo has expanded more, even opening up a location in Manhattan, but OneZo is unique as it creates its boba pearls from scratch, meaning there are no additives or artificial flavorings. They're able to control the product from start to finish, which makes you feel a little bit better about drinking bubble tea. They claim to be the world's first bubble tea brand to serve made-in-house fresh boba, which is certainly difficult to find. I got the brown sugar boba milk, which had perfectly chewy tapioca pearls coated in a sticky brown sugar mixture. This place has many locations throughout California and is slowly making its way throughout the U.S.. OneZo is an absolute MUST-TRY! Factory Tea Bar Strawberry Green Tea with Boba Pearls and Lychee Jelly (ft. Antonia) Factory Tea Bar (FTB) is a popular boba tea spot located in San Gabriel, with an additional location at USC. This is one of my sister's favorite spots to get boba tea, so she took us to the San Gabriel location when visiting. Immediately upon arrival, we noticed that the place was bustling with people. There were people playing board games and just sitting on the couch, and this was around 9:30PM! We ordered our drinks, which took about 10 minutes to prepare, but the wait was worth it! The boba pearls were as chewy as we liked. FTB also serves classic Asian snack foods, like popcorn chicken, fried gyoza, sweet potato fries, &amp;amp; more, and they also have an extensive drink menu with lots of topping options. ( + ) show me the food! Places: Korean Friendship Bell The Korean Friendship Bell is a bell and pavilion located in San Pedro, next to Long Beach. The bell was donated by the Republic of Korea in 1976 to signify the strong friendship between the U.S. and Korea, as well as to honor the Korean War Veterans. The patterns of the bell are modeled after the Bronze Bell of King Songdok that was built in 771 A.D. and is still on display today. The pavilion was stunning, as you are able to go up close and see the intricate design of the bell. It is set with a background view of Long Beach, and you are even able to see Los Angeles from afar. It is a little bit of a drive from Downtown L.A. but it is a must-see in my opinion! Downtown L.A. This is really the high-rise, typical city part of L.A., where you can find art galleries, markets, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and lots more. Because of our limited time there, we really just window-shopped, &quot;people watched&quot;, walked through the Japanese Village Plaza, and checked out Little Tokyo. There are endless things to find in DTLA, as it has great wall art and lots of areas to do some light flea-market shopping + walking. ( + ) show me where to go! For the rest of the time, we did some sightseeing, like seeing the Queen Mary Ship, a cruise ship that my dad and sister went on about 15 years ago, as well as visiting the Museum of Selfies, seeing Antonia’s school, and exploring Pasadena and its surrounding areas. We definitely had a packed 3 days, where we enjoyed some of the best food and saw a few beautiful sights in L.A.. I cannot wait till my next time in L.A., because I clearly have lots more to see in what this huge city has to offer! At the Queen Mary Ship 🚢</summary></entry></feed>
