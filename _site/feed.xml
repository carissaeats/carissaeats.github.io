&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yama-nyc.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yama Sushi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is definitely a spot you‚Äôd skip over at first glance. It has an unassuming, dark exterior to go along with its basement location, so it wouldn‚Äôt be somewhere I‚Äôd choose initially, but this restaurant is my dad‚Äôs favorite place in New York. About 20 years ago, my dad used to commute to work in Manhattan before he switched to working at home, but he discovered Yama with his coworkers in the early days of his job. The basement-esque location we go to now is different than the one he used to go to, but he says this one is just as good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad loves to eat fish, especially sashimi, and even though I‚Äôm really not a big fan of fish, I do like sashimi and sushi. I hope that I‚Äôll be able to explore Japan one day to try authentic food, but for now, Yama serves high-quality, thinly sliced sashimi fish that keeps my family super happy. The ‚Äúsashimi entree‚Äù of assorted sashimi is my dad‚Äôs favorite meal to eat. The sashimi is sliced thinner than a lot of sushi restaurants do, with pieces that are longer too. They are served on top of perilla leaves that are a perfect palate cleanser, and eating rice in between slices is recommended too. I wish I could tell you the types of fish in this selection, but I can definitely say there‚Äôs salmon and tuna (sorry!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/yamasushi/yamasashimi.JPG&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Sashimi Entree!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my sister and dad get the sashimi entree, I opt for a hot dish-sushi combo bento box. A bento is simply a box of an assortment of rice/noodles, meat, &amp;amp; vegetables that‚Äôs very popular throughout East Asia. The photo at the &lt;a href=&quot;/nyceats/2020/05/03/yamasushi.html/#lunchbento&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;very top&lt;/a&gt; is the lunch version, where you can choose 2 entrees out of many options, such as tonkatsu, ginger pork, tempura, sushi, hamachi kama, just to name a few. I love their chicken karaage, and even though I haven‚Äôt had a huge amount of karaage, this is my personal favorite! I also get their sushi, which is nigiri-style, which is just a slice of raw fish over sushi rice. I have noticed that the raw fish used on the sushi is warmer and not as high-quality as the sashimi alone, but it‚Äôs still great. The steam from the rice does wlightly warm the raw fish a bit, so it‚Äôs not the very chilled temperature that the sashimi retains. The box is accompanied with fresh orange slices and broiled fish - even for those aren‚Äôt the biggest fish fans (me), this fish is so tender, flaky, and well-flavored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner boxes work a little differently, as you don‚Äôt get as much control on what comes with the box, besides your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki and sushi or sashimi. The box comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, fried shrimp shumai, rice, and ginger dressed salad. It‚Äôs perfect for people who want to sample multiple things, which is great for people who are a little indecisive when it comes to food (me, again).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish we‚Äôve tried is the spicy tuna crispy rice. One of the most popular dishes in American-Japanese restaurants, Yama makes it look incredibly fancy. This dish is just a fried sushi rice ‚Äúplatform‚Äù topped with spicy tuna and more mayo/chives. It‚Äôs pretty simple, but it‚Äôs a dish that combines crunch with some light spice. I think it‚Äôs a great introduction to those who‚Äôve never had raw fish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been going to Yama for a few years now, and I really feel fully satisfied every time. Japanese food is something that can be so excited, and while I‚Äôm not sure that Yama is super authentic, I can confidently say that they serve very high-quality fish that is sliced a little differently than your typical sushi restaurant. Yama is a very relaxed setting, and the portions are well-priced for the amount. If you work in the city or are just in the mood for a casual sushi lunch with quality you know you can trust, Yama is your place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://taiyakinyc.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taiyaki NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is known for their Japanese fish-shaped cones filled with soft serve ice cream. The texture of the cones are a little bit like waffles, but so much better. Traditionally, they‚Äôre stuffed with anko, or sweet red azuki bean paste, but Taiyaki offers them with custard filling too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶BUT! Today, we‚Äôre talking about their fluffy pancakes! Although they‚Äôve been popular in Japan for a while now, fluffy pancakes have just started making their splash in New York City. It‚Äôs really no surprise that these pancakes are gaining so much popularity - their taller-than-average height and jiggly movement make for a fun dish to eat. This is achieved through separating the egg yolks from the egg whites, the latter of which is beaten until stiff peaks are attained. This meringue is gently folded into the batter, which makes these pancakes extra fluffy because of the air bubbles formed during this process. However, these pancakes are so much more than their stunning appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked that these pancakes were just as tasty as how stunning they looked. Given that a good part of the batter is that meringue, my initial expectation was that it would mostly taste of egg whites. I really was surprised by the great balance in taste - they have a really subtle, but just strong enough, sweetness, custard-y taste, and slight browning on the outside. Since I don‚Äôt like my desserts too sweet, these pancakes really were everything I wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/pancake/fluffywhite.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiyaki NYC offers these pancakes in two ways. The pancakes I tried were topped with a soft matcha cream sauce and a crispy mini anko-filled taiyaki, and served with a side of whipped cream, but you can also get them your classic style with a pat of butter, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and a side of syrup. Since these pancakes are just so good on their own, either way will taste absolutely fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about these pancakes that were taking NYC by storm through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taiyakinyc&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@taiyakinyc&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram and was incredibly excited to try them out, but Taiyaki NYC only sells these cakes from Fridays to Sundays, 11am-2pm at their Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Boston locations for now, to ensure that their product is quality-controlled. So, my first souffl√© pancake experience was actually at the Smorgasburg Outdoor Food Market that takes place from late March to October in Williamsburg. A stand, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Fluffysnyc/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluffy‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was a new vendor for the 2019 season that specializes in souffl√© pancakes. The only difference I could find was that Fluffy‚Äôs pancakes were slightly undercooked, which you even might be able to notice in the photo below. This is probably due to the overwhelming lines at their stand - Fluffy‚Äôs was undoubtedly one of the most popular vendors at the market. Fluffy‚Äôs also offers a lot more variety in flavors offered, including blueberry cheesecake (pictured below), cr√®me br√ªl√©e (yes, sounds incredible!), Nutella, and a rotating vegan option too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever you find your fluffy souffl√© pancakes, I have no doubt that you‚Äôll enjoy them. From what I‚Äôve seen, a reasonable &lt;em&gt;New York City&lt;/em&gt; price for about 2 pancakes will run ~$10-$12. I‚Äôve seen some places run their prices up to $20 for two, not so tall, fluffy pancakes, which I can‚Äôt justify buying whatsoever. Taiyaki NYC makes an absolutely fantastic pancake, as does Fluffy‚Äôs *, and I highly recommend that if the time (Fridays-Sundays, 11am-2pm) and price work for you, have these pancakes as a really lovely end-of-the-week treat ü•û.&lt;/p&gt;

        Pork belly, Bistro Hanger Steak, Spicy Pork, and Assorted Veggie Packet
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 700 locations world wide, the global franchise restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku, is definitely not unique to NYC, but I do live close to the city, so Manhattan is the most accessible place for me to enjoy their Japanese barbecue. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gyu-kaku.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restaurant‚Äôs website&lt;/a&gt;, the name, Gyu-Kaku, means ‚ÄúHorn of the Bull‚Äù in Japanese. The chain strives to replicate an authentic yakiniku, or grilled meat barbecue, dining experience that isn‚Äôt so easy to find outside of Japan. Although I‚Äôve never been to Japan, what matters is that Gyu-Kaku still serves high-quality dishes prepared with lots of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real charm about this place is how worth it the food is, ESPECIALLY if you go during their ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù, where they offer many dishes at a discounted price (GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!!). You get so much food for a reasonable price, making this one of my all-time favorite meals. I leave feeling so whole-hearted every time without my dad needing to spend way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Gyu-Kaku, yakiniku is grill-it-yourself! You can &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; think about it like Korean BBQ, but the taste is REALLY quite different from Korean barbecue. However, if you like KBBQ, I have no doubts that you‚Äôll LOVE yakinuku! They are both very unique dining experiences, as in my opinion, a Korean BBQ meal is only complete with a large set of banchan side dishes, such as your typical kimchi, Kongnamul bean sprouts, mung bean jelly, among MANY, many others (I am by no means an expert on either KBBQ or yakiniku, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a lot) that are meant to be enjoyed alongside the meal, whereas yakiniku can be enjoyed with simpler accompaniments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/gyukakulayout.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The Layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first order of business: the meat! They offer TONS of different types of meat, such as chicken, duck, pork belly, salmon, BBQ calamari, Japanese-style pork sausage, and of course, beef. I would say the stars of the show are the beef preparations, however, as their beef options range from classic thin beef tongue to premium USDA Prime kalbi short ribs. You can choose from meat marinated in their signature marinades* OR just naked meat with some salt + pepper - you can‚Äôt go wrong with either!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;-all-of-their-sauces--marinades-are-gluten-free&quot;&gt;* All of their sauces + marinades are gluten-free!!&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite meat (beef) options are the garlic-marinated bistro hanger steak, ultra-thin, super-fatty toro beef, and of course for a treat, the kalbi short ribs marinated in sweet soy tare. Those might be my favorites, but ANY of their meat options, beyond just beef, are absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the sauce bottle trio on the side of your table!! The best sauce is the combo of all three, ponzu, sweet soy, and ‚Äúspicy‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that as a yakiniku restaurant, the premise behind the whole place is their grilled meat. But the things that keep me coming back are their incredible plates of cooked dishes that make you feel so cozy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been coming to Gyu-Kaku for as long as I can remember. My mom used to work in the city, and this spot was a favorite among her and her coworkers. When my sister and I were first introduced, we couldn‚Äôt stop coming back!! So this place really brings back a lot of fond memories that make my heart warm every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/garlicnoodles.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Is your mouth watering yet?!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dish that I‚Äôd like to talk about is their &lt;strong&gt;garlic noodles&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me tell you, if Gyu-Kaku ONLY sold these noodles, I‚Äôd be okay with it. This is the first dish I ever ate Gyu-Kaku, and I‚Äôve loved them for as long as I can remember. The dish is made with thick, udon-style, egg noodles that are coated in a slightly sweetened garlic sauce and vegetables. You have the choice of ground chicken, vegetables, or shrimp. They‚Äôre served on a cast-iron plate, which slightly browns the outsides of the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/gyukaku/tunariceportrait.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The &quot;Volcano&quot;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish I love is their absolutely non-traditional, but no less mouthwatering, &lt;strong&gt;spicy tuna volcano&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs a crispy fried block of rice topped with spicy tuna over a layer of Japanese shoyu BBQ sauce. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two dishes are some of their best-sellers, and it‚Äôs not difficult to see why. These might be my two favorites, but not far behind (at all) are any of their &lt;strong&gt;bibimbap rice dishes&lt;/strong&gt; that achieve glorious browning from their hot stone bowls and their &lt;strong&gt;tuna pok√© nachos&lt;/strong&gt; - something about a fried wonton skin just feels right, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyu-Kaku will forever have a special place in my heart, as it has been since I was young. This restaurant chain makes food that is so effortlessly comforting and tasty. I can confidently say that I‚Äôve never had a bad dish from here, despite the overwhelmingly large menu. Even though the place isn‚Äôt catered towards vegetarians, they make some great grilled veggies (with or without a touch of butter), of which I recommend the corn, and salads too. If you aren‚Äôt stuffed by the end, they also serve great desserts, like cr√™pe cake slices from Lady M and chocolate lava cakes, of which I‚Äôve included photos below. I highly recommmend this place for any and all occasions, as they serve well-priced food that leaves you feeling happier than a traditional ‚Äú5-star‚Äù meal would.&lt;/p&gt;

According to the restaurant‚Äôs website, the name, Gyu-Kaku, means ‚ÄúHorn of the Bull‚Äù in Japanese. The chain strives to replicate an authentic yakiniku, or grilled meat barbecue, dining experience that isn‚Äôt so easy to find outside of Japan. Although I‚Äôve never been to Japan, what matters is that Gyu-Kaku still serves high-quality dishes prepared with lots of care. The real charm about this place is how worth it the food is, ESPECIALLY if you go during their ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù, where they offer many dishes at a discounted price (GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!!). You get so much food for a reasonable price, making this one of my all-time favorite meals. I leave feeling so whole-hearted every time without my dad needing to spend way too much. At Gyu-Kaku, yakiniku is grill-it-yourself! You can kind of think about it like Korean BBQ, but the taste is REALLY quite different from Korean barbecue. However, if you like KBBQ, I have no doubts that you‚Äôll LOVE yakinuku! They are both very unique dining experiences, as in my opinion, a Korean BBQ meal is only complete with a large set of banchan side dishes, such as your typical kimchi, Kongnamul bean sprouts, mung bean jelly, among MANY, many others (I am by no means an expert on either KBBQ or yakiniku, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a lot) that are meant to be enjoyed alongside the meal, whereas yakiniku can be enjoyed with simpler accompaniments. The Layout So the first order of business: the meat! They offer TONS of different types of meat, such as chicken, duck, pork belly, salmon, BBQ calamari, Japanese-style pork sausage, and of course, beef. I would say the stars of the show are the beef preparations, however, as their beef options range from classic thin beef tongue to premium USDA Prime kalbi short ribs. You can choose from meat marinated in their signature marinades* OR just naked meat with some salt + pepper - you can‚Äôt go wrong with either!! * All of their sauces + marinades are gluten-free!! My personal favorite meat (beef) options are the garlic-marinated bistro hanger steak, ultra-thin, super-fatty toro beef, and of course for a treat, the kalbi short ribs marinated in sweet soy tare. Those might be my favorites, but ANY of their meat options, beyond just beef, are absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the sauce bottle trio on the side of your table!! The best sauce is the combo of all three, ponzu, sweet soy, and ‚Äúspicy‚Äù. I know that as a yakiniku restaurant, the premise behind the whole place is their grilled meat. But the things that keep me coming back are their incredible plates of cooked dishes that make you feel so cozy inside. I‚Äôve been coming to Gyu-Kaku for as long as I can remember. My mom used to work in the city, and this spot was a favorite among her and her coworkers. When my sister and I were first introduced, we couldn‚Äôt stop coming back!! So this place really brings back a lot of fond memories that make my heart warm every time. Is your mouth watering yet?! The first dish that I‚Äôd like to talk about is their garlic noodles. Let me tell you, if Gyu-Kaku ONLY sold these noodles, I‚Äôd be okay with it. This is the first dish I ever ate Gyu-Kaku, and I‚Äôve loved them for as long as I can remember. The dish is made with thick, udon-style, egg noodles that are coated in a slightly sweetened garlic sauce and vegetables. You have the choice of ground chicken, vegetables, or shrimp. They‚Äôre served on a cast-iron plate, which slightly browns the outsides of the noodles. The &quot;Volcano&quot;! Another dish I love is their absolutely non-traditional, but no less mouthwatering, spicy tuna volcano. It‚Äôs a crispy fried block of rice topped with spicy tuna over a layer of Japanese shoyu BBQ sauce. Enough said. These two dishes are some of their best-sellers, and it‚Äôs not difficult to see why. These might be my two favorites, but not far behind (at all) are any of their bibimbap rice dishes that achieve glorious browning from their hot stone bowls and their tuna pok√© nachos - something about a fried wonton skin just feels right, you know?

    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but first, dessert - who said dessert can't come first?! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Molly Moon's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of Seattle's most popular ice cream shops, was the first on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to their website, their &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/flavors&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Yeti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ice cream flavor is their signature sweet cream ice cream, but swirled with vanilla bean caramel and &quot;yeti&quot; granola, which are both made in-house, along with Theo chocolate bits. They make the creamiest ice cream, and knowing that everything is sourced locally, with no artificial additives, makes this ice cream even more lovable!!&lt;/p&gt;

This restaurant is one of my favorites from Asia, as my dad introduced it to me on our trip to China in 2018. I had always been a fan of xiaolongbao, but there's something so special about the way DTF prepares their ultra-thin wrappers and piping hot soup inside. While DTF is pricy for xiaolongbao, many will agree that indulging in these small dumplings of heaven are worth it. Please, DTF, come to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got just the plain Kurobata pork soup dumplings (the cheapest XLB option), but they also sell crab + pork ones that are my favorite kind. DTF also serves an even more indulgent option - the truffle Kurobata pork ones. If you love the unique taste of truffle, these are definitely for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Known for their breakfast bar, customers that order off the &quot;breakfast bar&quot; section are able to top their meal off with a &quot;selection of seasonal fruit, nuts, &amp;amp; whipped cream&quot;.

They are a dessert shop serving up the highest quality molten chocolate cakes, cookies, thick milkshakes, and warm dessert drinks. Their original cake, which was first served back in 2008, the Dark Decadence, is crafted with Theo chocolate, dry-burned caramel, nib toffee, + vanilla ice cream. They pride themselves on their dry-burned caramel, which takes long periods of intense concentration and patience (you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://getyourhotcakes.com/pages/dry-burned-caramel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).

Fresh Strawberry + &quot;Yeti&quot; Ice Cream According to their website, their Yeti ice cream flavor is their signature sweet cream ice cream, but swirled with vanilla bean caramel and &quot;yeti&quot; granola, which are both made in-house, along with Theo chocolate bits. They make the creamiest ice cream, and knowing that everything is sourced locally, with no artificial additives, makes this ice cream even more lovable!! Din Tai Fung SOUP-er good! Din Tai Fung (DTF), an international Shanghainese food chain originating from Taiwan that specializes in xiaolongbao (XLB), better known as soup dumplings. This restaurant is one of my favorites from Asia, as my dad introduced it to me on our trip to China in 2018. I had always been a fan of xiaolongbao, but there's something so special about the way DTF prepares their ultra-thin wrappers and piping hot soup inside. While DTF is pricy for xiaolongbao, many will agree that indulging in these small dumplings of heaven are worth it. Please, DTF, come to the East Coast. All 10 lil xiaolongbao for me üòÅ I got just the plain Kurobata pork soup dumplings (the cheapest XLB option), but they also sell crab + pork ones that are my favorite kind. DTF also serves an even more indulgent option - the truffle Kurobata pork ones. If you love the unique taste of truffle, these are definitely for you. Portage Bay Cafe Banana - ooo - nana. üçå Portage Bay Cafe is a very popular local Seattle brunch chain that serves a wide variety of benedicts, French toasts, pancakes, eggs, + assorted breakfast staples. Known for their breakfast bar, customers that order off the &quot;breakfast bar&quot; section are able to top their meal off with a &quot;selection of seasonal fruit, nuts, &amp;amp; whipped cream&quot;. I ordered the bananas foster french toast and topped it off with their fresh strawberries - so apPEELing üòã Bananas Foster French Toast with the kraken rum &amp;amp; caramel sauce Hot Cakes Molten Chocolate Cakery I lava chocolate lava cakes!! Dark Decadence Cake And Hot Cakes serves up a GOOOOOD one. They are a dessert shop serving up the highest quality molten chocolate cakes, cookies, thick milkshakes, and warm dessert drinks. Their original cake, which was first served back in 2008, the Dark Decadence, is crafted with Theo chocolate, dry-burned caramel, nib toffee, + vanilla ice cream. They pride themselves on their dry-burned caramel, which takes long periods of intense concentration and patience (you can read more about it here). It's worth it though - you can taste the quality in each bite of this cake + its sidekicks. A must-stop when in Seattle! Facebook South Lake Union To kick-off Intern Family Weekend, Facebook Seattle hosted a Kick-Off Social. We enjoyed appetizers (which we easily turned into a meal) provided by Facebook catering. All the hype about the Facebook cafeterias is for a reason - they're redefining the term cafeteria. Facebook offices also include microkitchens on every floor, where employees are allowed to grab snacks + drinks as they please. Teriyaki Chicken Skewers, Peanut Lettuce Wraps, Popcorn Tofu with Sesame BBQ Sauce, and Soba Noodle Salad (not pictured) Teriyaki Chicken Skewers, Peanut Lettuce Wraps, Popcorn Tofu with Sesame BBQ Sauce, and Soba Noodle Salad (not pictured) ( + ) show me the food! Places: University Village Antonia stayed at the University of Washington over the summer, making University Village a convenient stop. UVillage is an open-air shopping complex, with numerous gourmet eateries + shops. It's easily one of the most beautiful shopping centers I've been to. Facebook South Lake Union Let me just start off by saying how BEAUTIFUL the Facebook campus is. Here's just a few photos: ( + ) show more Facebook campus photos! Just wow, right? üòç You can even see the Space Needle from the rooftop, among many other Seattle attractions. Seriously, Facebook Seattle is a real destination if you get the chance!! Pike Place Market + Great Gum Wall + Original Starbucks @ the Gum Wall! (with my silly sister) We checked out the original Starbucks and tried the Pike Place blend and blackberry lemonade iced tea. Pike Place had a wide variety of local artisan shops and a fish market, which were all fun to explore. Starbucks Reserve Roastery in Capitol Hill Stunning üòç This is the first Starbucks Roastery in the world, where they opened in 2014 in the vibrant Capitol Hill district. They create super innovative drinks and serve up pastries. Try to stop by here before you get a lava cake from Hot Cakes! Chihuly Garden and Glass The artwork here is absolutely stunning and pops with color everywhere - I'm seriously obsessed with the art here! Space Needle ...but I mean, if you didn't see the Space Needle, did you see Seattle? The Seattle Great Wheel @ Pier 57 Also check out: Alki Beach, CenturyLink Field, Museum of Pop (MoPOP) ( + ) show me where to go! Seattle has a ton to see, with lots of modern aspects, but still retaining the incredible history of the Pacific Northwest. I went to Seattle to visit my older sister, Antonia, at her internship, but if you‚Äôre just looking for a relaxing vacation getaway, don‚Äôt sleep on Seattle!!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Los Angeles</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/beyond/2020/06/02/losangeles.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Los Angeles" /><published>2020-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-02T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/beyond/2020/06/02/losangeles</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/beyond/2020/06/02/losangeles.html">&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WELCOME TO THE CITY OF ANGELS! Having lived in the same place my whole life on the East Coast, I had always been interested in life on the West Coast. New York City is a very fast city - everyone is always on the move and in a rush. Los Angeles is what some might consider NYC‚Äôs polar opposite. As die-hard New Yorkers say, if the only thing you can say about your city is that the weather is good, the city &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; just isn‚Äôt that good. SoCal is known for its warmer weather throughout the year, but there‚Äôs so much more to this wonderful city than just the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L.A. goes at a slower pace than NYC, giving it a more relaxed feel. But, with both cities, there are great things and some not-so-fantastic things. NYC is a city made to be explored through public transportation and by foot, especially given Manhattan‚Äôs smart grid design. You pretty much &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a car to get around, which means the notorious L.A. traffic. However, my sister says the public transportation isn‚Äôt as terrible as people say it is, but‚Ä¶NYC definitely wins in that one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between the two, my winner is‚Ä¶ actually L.A.!! Many will disagree, but L.A. is such an inviting, exciting city that has endless free activities to enjoy and a food scene that I &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt; love more. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, NYC is an absolute food paradise, but I guess my taste buds are just happier in the L.A. sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è. Also, my mom spent a few years in California when she first immigrated to the U.S., so maybe it‚Äôs just in my blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my older sister, Antonia, actually goes to college in the L.A. area, so for Thanksgiving 2018, my dad and I went to spend time with her. We were only able to explore L.A. for about three days, so we didn‚Äôt get to see a whole lot, but that can be a good thing - L.A. keeps me coming back for more, and that means that I have something to look forward to the next time I return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the places I ate and visited during my Thanksgiving trip!&lt;/p&gt;

            GOAM - Green Onions and Mayo
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;          
    &lt;p&gt;
    Eating at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chinchikurin-usa.com/menu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;
    Chinchikurin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was my first time trying okonomiyaki. Since then, this dish has been 
    one of my all-time favorites! They serve Hiroshima okonomiyaki, which is one of 
    two main styles of okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake with okonomi- meaning 
    &quot;as you like&quot; and -yaki meaning &quot;cooked&quot;. Osaka style is a batter with all ingredients being 
    mixed inside, whereas each ingredient in the Hiroshima style is separated into its own layer, 
    allowing each layer to provide its own unique taste + texture. There's typically 11 (WOW!) layers, 
    with grilled noodles, vegetables, crepe-like batter, meat, and many more. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chinchikurin offers 9 ways to eat your Hiroshima okonomiyaki, and each way has its 
    own specific toppings. My family tried 3 ways, as each pancake can be eaten as a single portion. 
    We shared the GOAM (pictured above), which is green onions and mayo, the B&amp;amp;C, or the basil &amp;amp; 
    cheese, and the Chinchikurinyaki, which has the shioburiyaki ground beef mixture inside. All 
    okonomiyakis served have &quot;The Classic&quot; 
    as their base, which can be ordered plain without toppings. However, the toppings make these pancakes 
    even more exciting! It's such a fun experience to eat here, as you're able to use the &quot;hera&quot; (miniature spatula) 
    to cut into the okonomiyaki that's sitting utop a heated grill. Get the B&amp;amp;C if you like cheese - it was my favorite!! 
    Chinchikurin also has a takoyaki window if you just want a quick snack walking through Little Tokyo! I absolutely love 
    this place.

    &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I am a big fan of Buzzfeed's &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vtqDuUM1DmXwYYAQcyUwtcalp_SesZD&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Worth It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series, a show that compares a food dish at three different price points to determine which one is the most worth it for its price, hosted by Steven Lim and Andrew Ilnyckyj. For their steak episode, the one at the lowest price point of $12 was &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unclejohnsdtla.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Uncle John's Cafe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;'s steak and eggs dish. Uncle John's is an American-Chinese diner that serves up your favorite diner classics, like hot cakes and French toast, but also mixing up your egg dishes with chashu BBQ pork and honey garlic chicken wings. It's like a super fun, diner-centric American-Chinese takeout restaurant. Obviously, I had to try the affordable steak that was greatly loved by both Steven and Andrew!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        I tried their famous $12 steak and eggs * that's served with your choice of side and toast. I chose mine to go with fried rice, white toast, and sunny-side up eggs, and boy, these portions are HUGE - TOTALLY WORTH IT! The fried rice was very plain, as it seemed like it was only tossed in soy sauce and scallions. The eggs were just how I liked them, with some slight browning on the edges and runny yolks. The steak was a bit chewier, but it was cooked to a great temperature and well-seasoned. 
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The real star of Uncle John's is the spicy pork chops. They're lightly fried and really pack a punch of flavor. The chops have a slight kick, but are also really well-seasoned. My dad got the pork chops with a side of chow mein, which we all really enjoyed. I'd say that this place is a great place if you're looking for a cheap meal with a whole lot of food. Uncle John's also trades in their diner classics for Cajun seafood at night, which I will definitely be trying the next time I come back to visit!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;
    * &lt;em&gt;The price of the steak and eggs has slowly gone up due to the increasing popularity, so I've seen on Yelp that
        it's now around $14. 
    &lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        I know Hollywood is pretty much a place that most locals want to avoid, but I was on a mission to find a good steakhouse! After doing some light research, I stumbled upon &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mussoandfrankgrill.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood since its opening in 1919. The restaurant has an extensive menu that covers all your favorite steakhouse classics and is also super old-school and is pretty dark-lit. When my family eats steak, we like to eat ribeye, so we got one bone-in and one boneless. Both had very defined grill marks and were each very flavorful, but sadly, the portions were really small for the price, which was disappointing. We also got the French-cut lamb chops, which paired well with the mint jelly on the side. We also got some sauteed onions and mac &amp;amp; cheese, which are my go-to steakhouse sides. Overall, I really did enjoy the meal and loved the setting that gives you an idea of what it was like 100 years ago, but the portions were smaller than expected. I would recommend Musso &amp;amp; Frank as one to try if you're in Hollywood!

My dad and sister ordered the chef's choice sashimi lunch, which I was able to try and see how fresh the fish was. We also tried the kurobota pork ginger, which definitely had a more subtle flavor. The pork worked really well with the slaw on the side and is a dish that I definitely recommend! I also had the salmon lover roll, which had fresh AND cooked salmon incorporated into the roll - the name itself should tell you that this roll is for salmon lovers!! Osawa also has shabu counter, which my sister indulges in for special occasions. I look forward to being able to try that in the future!

SoCal locations and is famous for their MilkyBun, a warm donut stuffed with ice cream and toppings of your choice. I don't believe that Afters is a franchise, so all locations are quality-controlled and should be consistent. The Pasadena location is styled as a gas-station and gives off a retro feeling that oddly fits so well with ice cream. My dad always gets a triple scoop that the three of us split, as it's a lot cheaper to get a triple scoop than three individual singles. We tried their Jasmine milk tea, cookie butter, and Vietnamese coffee flavors, which were happy to find that their tastes matched their names. Afters doesn't use artificial flavorings, so each taste was true to their promised flavors. We also tried their MilkyBun, which was just as good as a donut-ice cream pair sounds (amazing üòã).

            Brown Sugar Boba
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Something remarkable to me is how bubble tea shops in L.A. are not just the regular global franchises, like Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, CoCo, etc., but rather smaller localized chains or mom and pop shops. On the East Coast, bubble tea shops are almost purely these chains, with very few small businesses completely specializing in bubble tea. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.onezo.us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;OneZo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has expanded more, even opening up a location in Manhattan, but OneZo is unique as it creates its boba pearls from scratch, meaning there are no additives or artificial flavorings. They're able to control the product from start to finish, which makes you feel a little bit better about drinking bubble tea. They claim to be the world's first bubble tea brand to serve made-in-house fresh boba, which is certainly difficult to find. I got the brown sugar boba milk, which had perfectly chewy tapioca pearls coated in a sticky brown sugar mixture. This place has many locations throughout California and is slowly making its way throughout the U.S.. OneZo is an absolute MUST-TRY!

This is one of my sister's favorite spots to get boba tea, so she took us to the San Gabriel location when visiting. Immediately upon arrival, we noticed that the place was bustling with people. There were people playing board games and just sitting on the couch, and this was around 9:30PM! We ordered our drinks, which took about 10 minutes to prepare, but the wait was worth it! The boba pearls were as chewy as we liked. FTB also serves classic Asian snack foods, like popcorn chicken, fried gyoza, sweet potato fries, &amp;amp; more, and they also have an extensive drink menu with lots of topping options.

The bell was donated by the Republic of Korea in 1976 to signify the strong friendship between the U.S. and Korea, as well as to honor the Korean War Veterans. The patterns of the bell are modeled after the Bronze Bell of King Songdok that was built in 771 A.D. and is still on display today. The pavilion was stunning, as you are able to go up close and see the intricate design of the bell. It is set with a background view of Long Beach, and you are even able to see Los Angeles from afar. It is a little bit of a drive from Downtown L.A. but it is a must-see in my opinion!

    &lt;p&gt;
        This is really the high-rise, typical city part of L.A., where you can find art galleries, markets, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and lots more. Because of our limited time there, we really just window-shopped, &quot;people watched&quot;, walked through the Japanese Village Plaza, and checked out Little Tokyo. There are endless things to find in DTLA, as it has great wall art and lots of areas to do some light flea-market shopping + walking.        
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the time, we did some sightseeing, like seeing the Queen Mary Ship, a cruise ship that my dad and sister went on about 15 years ago, as well as visiting the Museum of Selfies, seeing Antonia‚Äôs school, and exploring Pasadena and its surrounding areas. We definitely had a packed 3 days, where we enjoyed some of the best food and saw a few beautiful sights in L.A.. I cannot wait till my next time in L.A., because I clearly have lots more to see in what this huge city has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;

Having lived in the same place my whole life on the East Coast, I had always been interested in life on the West Coast. New York City is a very fast city - everyone is always on the move and in a rush. Los Angeles is what some might consider NYC‚Äôs polar opposite. As die-hard New Yorkers say, if the only thing you can say about your city is that the weather is good, the city probably just isn‚Äôt that good. SoCal is known for its warmer weather throughout the year, but there‚Äôs so much more to this wonderful city than just the weather. L.A. goes at a slower pace than NYC, giving it a more relaxed feel. But, with both cities, there are great things and some not-so-fantastic things. NYC is a city made to be explored through public transportation and by foot, especially given Manhattan‚Äôs smart grid design. You pretty much need a car to get around, which means the notorious L.A. traffic. However, my sister says the public transportation isn‚Äôt as terrible as people say it is, but‚Ä¶NYC definitely wins in that one. Between the two, my winner is‚Ä¶ actually L.A.!! Many will disagree, but L.A. is such an inviting, exciting city that has endless free activities to enjoy and a food scene that I personally love more. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, NYC is an absolute food paradise, but I guess my taste buds are just happier in the L.A. sunshine ‚òÄÔ∏è. Also, my mom spent a few years in California when she first immigrated to the U.S., so maybe it‚Äôs just in my blood? So my older sister, Antonia, actually goes to college in the L.A. area, so for Thanksgiving 2018, my dad and I went to spend time with her. We were only able to explore L.A. for about three days, so we didn‚Äôt get to see a whole lot, but that can be a good thing - L.A. keeps me coming back for more, and that means that I have something to look forward to the next time I return. Check out the places I ate and visited during my Thanksgiving trip! We went all over L.A. metro area, including San Gabriel Valley, Long Beach, Hollywood, Little Tokyo, and more, so it‚Äôll definitely be a drive around! The Destinations Foods: Chinchikurin GOAM - Green Onions and Mayo Eating at Chinchikurin was my first time trying okonomiyaki. Since then, this dish has been one of my all-time favorites! They serve Hiroshima okonomiyaki, which is one of two main styles of okonomiyaki. Okonomiyaki is a savory pancake with okonomi- meaning &quot;as you like&quot; and -yaki meaning &quot;cooked&quot;. Osaka style is a batter with all ingredients being mixed inside, whereas each ingredient in the Hiroshima style is separated into its own layer, allowing each layer to provide its own unique taste + texture. There's typically 11 (WOW!) layers, with grilled noodles, vegetables, crepe-like batter, meat, and many more. Chinchikurin offers 9 ways to eat your Hiroshima okonomiyaki, and each way has its own specific toppings. My family tried 3 ways, as each pancake can be eaten as a single portion. We shared the GOAM (pictured above), which is green onions and mayo, the B&amp;amp;C, or the basil &amp;amp; cheese, and the Chinchikurinyaki, which has the shioburiyaki ground beef mixture inside. All okonomiyakis served have &quot;The Classic&quot; as their base, which can be ordered plain without toppings. However, the toppings make these pancakes even more exciting! It's such a fun experience to eat here, as you're able to use the &quot;hera&quot; (miniature spatula) to cut into the okonomiyaki that's sitting utop a heated grill. Get the B&amp;amp;C if you like cheese - it was my favorite!! Chinchikurin also has a takoyaki window if you just want a quick snack walking through Little Tokyo! I absolutely love this place. Uncle John's Cafe Steak + Eggs Spicy Pork Chops + Chow Mein I am a big fan of Buzzfeed's Worth It series, a show that compares a food dish at three different price points to determine which one is the most worth it for its price, hosted by Steven Lim and Andrew Ilnyckyj. For their steak episode, the one at the lowest price point of $12 was Uncle John's Cafe's steak and eggs dish. Uncle John's is an American-Chinese diner that serves up your favorite diner classics, like hot cakes and French toast, but also mixing up your egg dishes with chashu BBQ pork and honey garlic chicken wings. It's like a super fun, diner-centric American-Chinese takeout restaurant. Obviously, I had to try the affordable steak that was greatly loved by both Steven and Andrew! I tried their famous $12 steak and eggs * that's served with your choice of side and toast. I chose mine to go with fried rice, white toast, and sunny-side up eggs, and boy, these portions are HUGE - TOTALLY WORTH IT! The fried rice was very plain, as it seemed like it was only tossed in soy sauce and scallions. The eggs were just how I liked them, with some slight browning on the edges and runny yolks. The steak was a bit chewier, but it was cooked to a great temperature and well-seasoned. The real star of Uncle John's is the spicy pork chops. They're lightly fried and really pack a punch of flavor. The chops have a slight kick, but are also really well-seasoned. My dad got the pork chops with a side of chow mein, which we all really enjoyed. I'd say that this place is a great place if you're looking for a cheap meal with a whole lot of food. Uncle John's also trades in their diner classics for Cajun seafood at night, which I will definitely be trying the next time I come back to visit! * The price of the steak and eggs has slowly gone up due to the increasing popularity, so I've seen on Yelp that it's now around $14. Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill Ribeyes, Mac &amp;amp; Cheese, Lamb Chops, Sauteed Onions I know Hollywood is pretty much a place that most locals want to avoid, but I was on a mission to find a good steakhouse! After doing some light research, I stumbled upon Musso &amp;amp; Frank Grill, the oldest restaurant in Hollywood since its opening in 1919. The restaurant has an extensive menu that covers all your favorite steakhouse classics and is also super old-school and is pretty dark-lit. When my family eats steak, we like to eat ribeye, so we got one bone-in and one boneless. Both had very defined grill marks and were each very flavorful, but sadly, the portions were really small for the price, which was disappointing. We also got the French-cut lamb chops, which paired well with the mint jelly on the side. We also got some sauteed onions and mac &amp;amp; cheese, which are my go-to steakhouse sides. Overall, I really did enjoy the meal and loved the setting that gives you an idea of what it was like 100 years ago, but the portions were smaller than expected. I would recommend Musso &amp;amp; Frank as one to try if you're in Hollywood! Osawa Pasadena Salmon Lover Sushi Roll Osawa Pasadena is an authentic Japanese restaurant in Pasadena that not only serves up your standard sushi and sashimi, but also hot dishes that aren't frequently seen in Japanese restaurants across America. My dad and sister ordered the chef's choice sashimi lunch, which I was able to try and see how fresh the fish was. We also tried the kurobota pork ginger, which definitely had a more subtle flavor. The pork worked really well with the slaw on the side and is a dish that I definitely recommend! I also had the salmon lover roll, which had fresh AND cooked salmon incorporated into the roll - the name itself should tell you that this roll is for salmon lovers!! Osawa also has shabu counter, which my sister indulges in for special occasions. I look forward to being able to try that in the future! Afters Ice Cream Triple Scoop! Afters Ice Cream has 27 (and counting!) SoCal locations and is famous for their MilkyBun, a warm donut stuffed with ice cream and toppings of your choice. I don't believe that Afters is a franchise, so all locations are quality-controlled and should be consistent. The Pasadena location is styled as a gas-station and gives off a retro feeling that oddly fits so well with ice cream. My dad always gets a triple scoop that the three of us split, as it's a lot cheaper to get a triple scoop than three individual singles. We tried their Jasmine milk tea, cookie butter, and Vietnamese coffee flavors, which were happy to find that their tastes matched their names. Afters doesn't use artificial flavorings, so each taste was true to their promised flavors. We also tried their MilkyBun, which was just as good as a donut-ice cream pair sounds (amazing üòã). OneZo Brown Sugar Boba Something remarkable to me is how bubble tea shops in L.A. are not just the regular global franchises, like Kung Fu Tea, Gong Cha, CoCo, etc., but rather smaller localized chains or mom and pop shops. On the East Coast, bubble tea shops are almost purely these chains, with very few small businesses completely specializing in bubble tea. OneZo has expanded more, even opening up a location in Manhattan, but OneZo is unique as it creates its boba pearls from scratch, meaning there are no additives or artificial flavorings. They're able to control the product from start to finish, which makes you feel a little bit better about drinking bubble tea. They claim to be the world's first bubble tea brand to serve made-in-house fresh boba, which is certainly difficult to find. I got the brown sugar boba milk, which had perfectly chewy tapioca pearls coated in a sticky brown sugar mixture. This place has many locations throughout California and is slowly making its way throughout the U.S.. OneZo is an absolute MUST-TRY! Factory Tea Bar Strawberry Green Tea with Boba Pearls and Lychee Jelly (ft. Antonia) Factory Tea Bar (FTB) is a popular boba tea spot located in San Gabriel, with an additional location at USC. This is one of my sister's favorite spots to get boba tea, so she took us to the San Gabriel location when visiting. Immediately upon arrival, we noticed that the place was bustling with people. There were people playing board games and just sitting on the couch, and this was around 9:30PM! We ordered our drinks, which took about 10 minutes to prepare, but the wait was worth it! The boba pearls were as chewy as we liked. FTB also serves classic Asian snack foods, like popcorn chicken, fried gyoza, sweet potato fries, &amp;amp; more, and they also have an extensive drink menu with lots of topping options. ( + ) show me the food! Places: Korean Friendship Bell The Korean Friendship Bell is a bell and pavilion located in San Pedro, next to Long Beach. The bell was donated by the Republic of Korea in 1976 to signify the strong friendship between the U.S. and Korea, as well as to honor the Korean War Veterans. The patterns of the bell are modeled after the Bronze Bell of King Songdok that was built in 771 A.D. and is still on display today. The pavilion was stunning, as you are able to go up close and see the intricate design of the bell. It is set with a background view of Long Beach, and you are even able to see Los Angeles from afar. It is a little bit of a drive from Downtown L.A. but it is a must-see in my opinion! Downtown L.A. This is really the high-rise, typical city part of L.A., where you can find art galleries, markets, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and lots more. Because of our limited time there, we really just window-shopped, &quot;people watched&quot;, walked through the Japanese Village Plaza, and checked out Little Tokyo. There are endless things to find in DTLA, as it has great wall art and lots of areas to do some light flea-market shopping + walking. ( + ) show me where to go!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to The Big Easy, a city full of jazz, crazy good food, and of course, Mardi Gras! New Orleans (NOLA) is truly a city like no other. Yes, every city has its own unique charms, but NOLA has a distinctive, one-of-a-kind style and such a vibrant scene with endless things to do. New Orleans has high-rise buildings, but no one thinks of New Orleans with the high-rise reputation that NYC has. NOLA is in the Gulf Coast region, which means fresh seafood and maybe even a ~steamboat tour~ if you‚Äôd like (we did not, but you definitely can!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm so ready to share some restaurants I found in the exciting and multicultural food scene of New Orleans. This city is known for its Creole cuisine and French influences, but is also popular for its Vietnamese food, which makes sense, as both Louisiana and Vietnamese food are lightly French-inspired amongst many other influences. Scroll down below to check out the eats of this lively city!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
        New Orleans was actually a half-way on a very lengthy road trip that began in Florida and would conclude back at home in New Jersey. So after a few hour long car ride from Miramar Beach, our first stop was at &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maypoprestaurant.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Maypop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a Southeast Asian-inspired, contemporary Louisiana restaurant (I know, a mouthful). The restaurant has a classy feel, but it is still casual enough to walk in for a fun, enjoyable brunch, lunch, or dinner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Bone marrow is a very luxury item, and it's definitely not an easy dish to do well. I will say, I've never had a bad bone marrow dish in my life - the buttery and fatty inside is irresistible! This bone marrow is likely the best bone marrow dish I've had. It's topped with oxtail, sweet, caramelized onions, and gravy juices. It had such a complex, umami flavor that paired amazingly with the naan. I'm sure the dish has evolved a bit since I went, but I have no doubt that it's still just as good. We also tried the blue crab mapo tofu hand-pulled noodles, which was every bit as exciting as it sounds. The noodles had a great chew, and the sauce was slightly spiced, but definitely nothing too overwhelming. They also gave us these curry beignets as a starter, which is just about the best replacement for free restaurant bread you can get.

The steak was tasty, as expected, but it was made 100000x better by the Creole butter it was topped with! Definitely get the corn brulee too - this br√ªl√©ed, sweet, but a little savory, silky corn pudding is the perfect accompaniment to your steak. This restaurant is perfect for special occasions, but it is also very packed, so I'd be sure to get a reservation!

We tried their raw oysters on the half shell, BBQ shrimp and grits (pictured above), jambalaya, and the Louisiana crab cakes that are smothered in a crawfish cream sauce. The restaurant is in a great location, and it serves up a taste of New Orleans that feels comforting in this bustling city.

Did you even go to NOLA if you didn't eat a beignet?!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Caf√© du Monde has been doing their beignets since 1862, 24 hours a day (except Christmas day). These light and airy pockets of dough topped with mountains of powdered sugar are an irresistible treat. I was only in NOLA for two days, so I only had the opportunity to try beignets once, which was at Caf√© du Monde, so I'm not &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; sure where the best beignets are! I was extremely happy after trying Caf√© du Monde's beignets, so I would highly recommend it anyways üòä.

I went after our meal at Maypop to get their famous chocolate chip cookies and milk combination, which I shared with my sister. The cookies weren't extremely special in terms of taste, but they were perfectly soft and had a good amount of chocolate. I enjoyed their Tahitian vanilla milk as well. The retro-chic restaurant/caf√© was still busy even at ~9PM (not sure if eating late is just a New Orleans cultural thing), and it is well-reviewed online for their food. Since I only had the cookies, I can't say much about anything else, except that the decor of the place is very aesthetic!

Despite its old age, this cathedral is still well-preserved, as its triple steeples still shine nicely, and the building itself is still so purely clean. Upon the arrival Adrien De Pauger of France on 3/29/1721, the cathedral began its construction alongside Engineer-in-Chief of Louisiana, LeBlond de la Tour. The Cathedral-Basilica has been in use since 1727 and is named after King of France, Louis IX. The cathedral sits right by the Mississippi River and is conveniently located in the French Quarter, making this historic, beautiful sight difficult to miss.

&lt;p&gt;Being a self-proclaimed foodie, I have always wanted to visit New Orleans for its one-of-a-kind culture and uniquely diverse cuisine, and our road trip back to New Jersey allowed for it to be a perfect stop. My trip, while short, did not disappoint, as I got to eat my heart out and experience a small taste of what NOLA is like. Life here is like an exciting, all-day party, and I‚Äôd love to return someday!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="beyond" /><summary type="html">Bourbon Street Welcome to The Big Easy, a city full of jazz, crazy good food, and of course, Mardi Gras! New Orleans (NOLA) is truly a city like no other. Yes, every city has its own unique charms, but NOLA has a distinctive, one-of-a-kind style and such a vibrant scene with endless things to do. New Orleans has high-rise buildings, but no one thinks of New Orleans with the high-rise reputation that NYC has. NOLA is in the Gulf Coast region, which means fresh seafood and maybe even a ~steamboat tour~ if you‚Äôd like (we did not, but you definitely can!). I‚Äôm so ready to share some restaurants I found in the exciting and multicultural food scene of New Orleans. This city is known for its Creole cuisine and French influences, but is also popular for its Vietnamese food, which makes sense, as both Louisiana and Vietnamese food are lightly French-inspired amongst many other influences. Scroll down below to check out the eats of this lively city! The Destinations Foods: Maypop Bone Marrow Dish Hand-Pulled Blue Crab Mapo Tofu Noodles New Orleans was actually a half-way on a very lengthy road trip that began in Florida and would conclude back at home in New Jersey. So after a few hour long car ride from Miramar Beach, our first stop was at Maypop, a Southeast Asian-inspired, contemporary Louisiana restaurant (I know, a mouthful). The restaurant has a classy feel, but it is still casual enough to walk in for a fun, enjoyable brunch, lunch, or dinner. Bone marrow is a very luxury item, and it's definitely not an easy dish to do well. I will say, I've never had a bad bone marrow dish in my life - the buttery and fatty inside is irresistible! This bone marrow is likely the best bone marrow dish I've had. It's topped with oxtail, sweet, caramelized onions, and gravy juices. It had such a complex, umami flavor that paired amazingly with the naan. I'm sure the dish has evolved a bit since I went, but I have no doubt that it's still just as good. We also tried the blue crab mapo tofu hand-pulled noodles, which was every bit as exciting as it sounds. The noodles had a great chew, and the sauce was slightly spiced, but definitely nothing too overwhelming. They also gave us these curry beignets as a starter, which is just about the best replacement for free restaurant bread you can get. Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse Prime Cowboy Ribeye Corn Br√ªl√©e Dickie Brennan's Steakhouse is an award-winning classic steakhouse, but with a Creole twist. The steak was tasty, as expected, but it was made 100000x better by the Creole butter it was topped with! Definitely get the corn brulee too - this br√ªl√©ed, sweet, but a little savory, silky corn pudding is the perfect accompaniment to your steak. This restaurant is perfect for special occasions, but it is also very packed, so I'd be sure to get a reservation! The Original French Market Restaurant and Bar BBQ Shrimp + Grits After walking through the French Quarter for an afternoon, we did a quick search through Google Maps to stumble upon The Original French Market Restaurant and Bar, a family-owned Creole kitchen that prides themselves on making everything from scratch. We tried their raw oysters on the half shell, BBQ shrimp and grits (pictured above), jambalaya, and the Louisiana crab cakes that are smothered in a crawfish cream sauce. The restaurant is in a great location, and it serves up a taste of New Orleans that feels comforting in this bustling city. Caf√© du Monde Classic Beignets Arguably the most famous foodie destination of NOLA, Caf√© du Monde serves up beignets and several variations of caf√© au lait. Did you even go to NOLA if you didn't eat a beignet?! Caf√© du Monde has been doing their beignets since 1862, 24 hours a day (except Christmas day). These light and airy pockets of dough topped with mountains of powdered sugar are an irresistible treat. I was only in NOLA for two days, so I only had the opportunity to try beignets once, which was at Caf√© du Monde, so I'm not actually sure where the best beignets are! I was extremely happy after trying Caf√© du Monde's beignets, so I would highly recommend it anyways üòä. Willa Jean Cookies + Milk Willa Jean is a Southern-style restaurant named after Chef Partner Kelly Fields‚Äô grandmother. I went after our meal at Maypop to get their famous chocolate chip cookies and milk combination, which I shared with my sister. The cookies weren't extremely special in terms of taste, but they were perfectly soft and had a good amount of chocolate. I enjoyed their Tahitian vanilla milk as well. The retro-chic restaurant/caf√© was still busy even at ~9PM (not sure if eating late is just a New Orleans cultural thing), and it is well-reviewed online for their food. Since I only had the cookies, I can't say much about anything else, except that the decor of the place is very aesthetic! ( + ) show me the food! Places: Bourbon Street / French Quarter The French Quarter is the heart of New Orleans and one of the famous neighborhoods in America. You can find colorful buildings, Cajun food, and an endless assortment of activities here. There's jazz music playing throughout the streets, and you definitely won't be bored wherever you walk. The thirteen-block Bourbon Street has lots of nightlife for adults and is a whole street of celebration &amp;amp; joy. Garden District The Garden District is a lovely neighborhood and somewhat peaceful getaway from the lively French Quarter. Its streets are lined with oak trees and is filled with a large variety of homes, ranging from charming cottages to impressive multistory mansions, as well as stunning lush gardens to see. There are boutique shops and small caf√©s located in the district available to visit too. Saint Louis Cathedral Saint Louis Cathedral, the oldest cathedral in North America*, is one of New Orleans' most famous landmarks. Despite its old age, this cathedral is still well-preserved, as its triple steeples still shine nicely, and the building itself is still so purely clean. Upon the arrival Adrien De Pauger of France on 3/29/1721, the cathedral began its construction alongside Engineer-in-Chief of Louisiana, LeBlond de la Tour.

    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/patisserie/frenchtoastcrop.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patisserieflorentine.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Patisserie Florentine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (PF) is an extremely popular Bergen County breakfast, brunch, and lunch destination that serves up French-inspired dishes, baked goods, and freshly brewed coffee drinks.  &lt;!-- MORE --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since discovering this spot a few years back, it has become a favorite of mine. The unique part of this brunch spot is the twists it puts on classic American brunch staples, like eggs Benedict and French toast. PF truly elevates classics by incorporating in French techniques and bringing in the freshest ingredients and artisanal items.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service is pretty uninvolved, yet the lively ambience, glass display of bakery items, simple wooden decor, and natural sunlight somehow make up for it. I‚Äôve just barely scratched the surface of their extensive menu‚Ä¶but I‚Äôve never left a meal from PF unsatisfied, so I‚Äôm ecstatic to share a few of the dishes I‚Äôve enjoyed below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;belgian-waffles&quot;&gt;Belgian Waffles&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/patisserie/waffles.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The portion for the price ($12.25) is a little small, nonetheless, this dish is fantastic. Waffles are great, but my favorite kind are li√®ge-style, which are yeast-risen brioche waffles covered with pearl sugar bits. Li√®ge waffles are so chewy, yet slightly crispy on the outside thanks to the pearl sugar studs. You can choose how you want your waffles to be topped - bananas + caramel sauce OR fresh berries + chocolate sauce. Shown above is the banana + caramel sauce combination, but they added blueberries anyways, probably due to excess. Their caramel sauce is SO INCREDIBLE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;croissant-oeufs-fromage&quot;&gt;Croissant Oeufs Fromage&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/patisserie/patisserie.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;(Left) Belgian Waffles + (Right) Croissant Oeufs Fromage&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toasted croissant slices, avocado puree, melted mozzarella, gravlax (cured salmon), all topped off with two sunny side up eggs! Think of it like an elevated avocado toast with lox‚Äôs cousin, gravlax. The mozzarella cheese seems like an odd combo, with it being fish and cheese, but it all works so well together. One of the more underrated items at PF is the side salad that comes with many of the savory dishes. The dressing meshes so well with the mixed greens, and it makes for a great palate cleanser between bites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;omelette-royale&quot;&gt;Omelette Royale&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/patisserie/omelet.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Omelette stuffed with mushrooms, mozzarella, spinach, and onions&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs not exactly a French rolled omelette, but it is folded vertically and stuffed with your choice of toppings. The omelette is accompanied by pommes florentine (roasted potatoes), that crispy Israeli side salad, and a brioche roll with marmalade and garlic butter. This dish is arguably the biggest bang for your buck - $11.75 for this omelette that can barely fit on the plate AND served with a generous portion of sides! Here‚Äôs a tip: spread some of that garlic butter for the roll onto the potatoes &amp;amp; omelette!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;briochette-french-toast&quot;&gt;Briochette (French Toast)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/patisserie/frenchtoast.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This toast has a custardy filling that makes for the perfect bite. The star of this dish, though, is the vanilla anglaise, a dessert pouring custard sauce, which softens up the toast a little bit. Don‚Äôt be shy to ask for extra anglaise!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also tried some of their desserts, like the Fondant au Chocolat Noir and Gateaux Almandine. If you aren‚Äôt feeling too hungry, these desserts are great to fill that void, but you‚Äôll probably feel content after devouring any of their dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;            
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brunch stop gets really busy over the weekend, but I usually don‚Äôt have any trouble getting a table. PF has a lengthy menu that is sure to satisfy whatever cravings you have - sandwiches, breakfast staples, baked goods, decadent desserts, and even pasta!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jerseyeats" /><summary type="html">Patisserie Florentine (PF) is an extremely popular Bergen County breakfast, brunch, and lunch destination that serves up French-inspired dishes, baked goods, and freshly brewed coffee drinks.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I‚Äôm Gonna Stand Banh YOU!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jerseyeats/2020/05/03/mamieatery.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I‚Äôm Gonna Stand Banh YOU!" /><published>2020-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-05-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jerseyeats/2020/05/03/mamieatery</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jerseyeats/2020/05/03/mamieatery.html">&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot; text-align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mamieatery.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ma M√¨ Eatery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a fast casual Vietnamese eatery in Closter, and also the sister restaurant to the popular &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://simplyvietnamese.info/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Simply Vietnamese&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in Tenafly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ma M√¨ serves dishes like pho, banh mi, summer rolls, pad Thai, fried rice, salads, and bao buns. As a counter service restaurant, the service is quick, but the food is still made to order and always fresh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite Ma M√¨ dish is the &lt;strong&gt;original grilled pork banh mi&lt;/strong&gt;. If you‚Äôve never had banh mi, it‚Äôs a Vietnamese baguette that‚Äôs split open and filled to the brim with whatever ingredients your heart desired. Common to a typical banh mi, Ma M√¨‚Äôs OG sandwich is stuffed with juicy grilled pork, pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalape√±o, and creamy aioli. Other common ingredients to this sandwich are pat√© and Maggi seasoning sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/mami/sandwich.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I‚Äôll always stand by the original banh mi as my favorite, their &lt;strong&gt;pad Thai dumplings&lt;/strong&gt; really set them apart from other places. These fried pockets of pad Thai wrapped with wonton skin burst with flavor, especially when combined with their sweet + sour Nuoc Mam sauce!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/mami/ptwon.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre not feeling the extra crunch, they also make an incredible &lt;strong&gt;pad Thai&lt;/strong&gt; that might not be traditional, but has a unique sweet and tangy taste. They make their pad Thai with thin rice noodles instead of the flat and wide noodles you might be used to seeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/mami/mamipadthai.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more item I‚Äôd like to share is the &lt;strong&gt;50/50 Jasmine green tea and iced tea&lt;/strong&gt; from their ‚Äúsecret menu‚Äù. With mild notes of green tea and a slightly sour, but still sweet enough, lemon flavor, this drink is especially perfect to cool down on a hot day! If you‚Äôre not a fan, they also serve a classic Thai Iced Tea that‚Äôs a little more sweet, but great any time of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/jerseyeats/mami/jastea.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;singleimage&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve tried A LOT of foods from Ma M√¨, and I can say with confidence that I‚Äôve never had something I didn‚Äôt enjoy. If you‚Äôre in the area, be sure to put it on your list! It‚Äôs in the perfect location, being only 2 minutes away from Closter Plaza, where you can shop away and finish off with some dessert!
