&lt;p&gt;Happy Thanksgiving y‚Äôall! I wanted to say what the annual Turkey Day means to me, recap how I celebrated for the past few years (and say what I‚Äôm doing today), and share some Thanksgiving recipes from my favorite food bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does Thanksgiving mean to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In elementary and part of middle school, the Chinese community in my town would frequently have get-togethers (we used to hang out a lot!), and I would always look forward to the main event of the year: Thanksgiving dinner! Most, if not all of us (my town‚Äôs Chinese community), don‚Äôt have any extended family in the states, so our communal heritage brought us even closer as friends. As the years passed, though, we‚Äôve lowered it on our priorities list. Quarantine makes me feel even more nostalgic about those times, but I remain hopeful about seeing them in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But anyway‚Ä¶in the past few years, I‚Äôve felt the magic of this four-day weekend fizzle out, but I still feel an immense appreciation for this quick getaway from the hecticness of school. I also spend this time to share my gratitude for people who‚Äôve made a remarkable impact in my life in the past 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For 2020, I have a lot to be grateful for. Yes, it‚Äôs been a rough year; I‚Äôve had to be on lockdown completely for the past eight months and be &lt;em&gt;almost excessively&lt;/em&gt; cautious, because I live with my grandma. It has definitely taken a toll on me, but I‚Äôve had time to reflect on myself about many aspects of my life. This isn‚Äôt my journal, so I don‚Äôt want to delve in too deep, but I still want to share a a short list of the many things I‚Äôve been especially thankful for this year‚Ä¶here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve gotten to cultivate a relationship with my dad that wouldn‚Äôt have had the time to be nurtured in other circumstances (and that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to take away from how this pandemic has impacted millions; COVID-19 to have never happened would be ideal). Have we had our &lt;em&gt;very fair&lt;/em&gt; share of quarrels and times we‚Äôve needed to spend apart? Absolutely. But I learned to empathize with him like I had never before, and that‚Äôs just one thing to be thankful for.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simply being able to stay at home. My dad‚Äôs been working from home for at least 15 years now, so our family situation was minimally affected.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This. blog. I have no idea what 2020 would be without this. Even if no one is reading this, I am incredibly lucky to use this platform as a way to share my stories behind food and the businesses I want to share. I‚Äôm not too caught up with the size of my audience, because I do this for myself and my passion for culinary adventures. Building this blog from scratch is my ultimate passion project: there‚Äôs always something to be done, whether it‚Äôs the inner framework, the CSS design, the stories. And I cherish every moment with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Iberico Pork Pluma
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, my dad, Antonia, and I took our first trip in quite some time after we had a big event in our life happen earlier in the year. On Thanksgiving Day 2016, we headed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bonedaddies.com/restaurant/shackfuyu/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shack-Fuyu: The Japanese Restaurant by Bone Daddies&lt;/a&gt;. I kid you not, returning to this place is on my bucket list. Shack-Fuyu is the type of sit-down restaurant I‚Äôm most into - a spin on East Asian food with signature dishes and desserts. This spin doesn‚Äôt need to be a ‚Äúmodern‚Äù take, but needs to have a connection to the chef, in whichever way that may be. This dish is the Iberico Pork Pluma with Spring Onion and Black Pepper Miso. Get the Kinako French Toast with Matcha Soft Serve too. &lt;em&gt;Absolute chef‚Äôs kiss&lt;/em&gt;‚Ä¶okay, back to the Thanksgiving stuff. I went off on a tangent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/thanksgiving/chickiesandpetes.jpg&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Crab Fries from Chickie‚Äôs &amp;amp; Pete‚Äôs, Philly Airport (2018)&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;flex-item&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/stories/thanksgiving/becbagel2.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Bacon, Egg, Cheese Bagel from Celebrity Bagels (2019)&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I remember it being a Chinese get together. It‚Äôs only a vague memory, but my dad made a point about this gathering being one of my sister‚Äôs last before heading off to college. In 2018, my dad and I were on a flight to visit Antonia! We flew from the Philly airport (far cheaper than from JFK), so that day was just getting to the airport, waiting (we ate crab fries üòã), flying, and eating at pretty much the only restaurant still open on Thanksgiving day (a Hong Kong caf√©, IIRC). That weekend remains one of the favorite times in my life thus far. I was ‚Äúhomesick‚Äù for my sister, and it couldn‚Äôt have been a better getaway. Last year, I spent it by eating a BEC from Celebrity Bagels and just watching Netflix. This year will probably be similar: I‚Äôll be eating some good food, taking a break, and hanging with Antonia. And I cannot wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish off, I want to share some Thanksgiving recipes from my favorite food bloggers. Some are more traditional, but some may be unexpected combinations or fusion flavors. Enjoy (even if it may be too late to try these out for this year)!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve been a &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seonkyounglongest.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Seonkyoung Longest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; fan since the beginning! Her backstory is not without its challenges, but is inspiring when you see where she is today. She creates Korean, Chinese, and Japanese favorites, but also makes more experimental recipes like this one. She has a &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Korean-glazed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://seonkyounglongest.com/how-to-cook-lemongrass-turkey/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lemongrass&lt;/a&gt; turkey and &lt;a href=&quot;https://seonkyounglongest.com/cranberry-sauce/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;~spicy~ cranberry sauce&lt;/a&gt; recipe to check out as well. Fried rice stuffing blends two of my identities together (I am Chinese-American after all!), so I‚Äôm definitely optimistic about the results!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iamafoodblog.com/green-bean-casserole/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Green Bean Casserole&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The classic green bean casserole! I loveeeee the French-fried onions on the top of these. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iamafoodblog.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;i am a food blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; makes a ton of Asian/Asian-inspired recipes, along with a variety of other cuisines. This husband-wife duo has a stunning blog that I‚Äôve followed for years, and you‚Äôll be endlessly scrolling through their recipe index (not complaining though). They also have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iamafoodblog.com/thanksgiving/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guide to downsize your Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Like cinnamon rolls, but without the cream cheese frosting. It‚Äôs perfect for those with a lot of baking ingredients (flour, eggs, yeast, sugar, cinnamon, etc.), but don‚Äôt have cream cheese. I am those.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Half Baked Harvest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; exactly the way it should sound. It‚Äôs warm, comforting, and feels like home.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Half Baked Harvest&lt;/a&gt; one. A homey pie favorite turned into a pancake - can‚Äôt get better than that.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;These rolls &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have cream cheese frosting, but heck, this was too cool of a recipe not to share! &lt;a href=&quot;https://mynameisyeh.com&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Molly Yeh&lt;/a&gt; is a Jewish-Chinese musician turned cookbook author and farm girl. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs still a musician at her core, but I admire her most as an awesome food blogger with tons of narratives to share! She certainly draws inspiration from her experiences in all different walks of life, whether it be the city AND farm girl in her or her multiracial background.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made croissants from scratch for the first time! Ever since my sister, Antonia, a croissant connoisseur (just kidding, she‚Äôs only made croissants twice before), told me she made croissants from scratch, I‚Äôve been itching to try making them too. It‚Äôs month eight of being totally at home, so we finally decided to tackle this challenge!

&lt;p&gt;Food represents celebration, warmth, and unity to me. At its core, food brings people together, whether it‚Äôs an excuse to catch up with old friends or just enjoying a meal with the people you love. Food helps us get through tough times, but makes the happy times even sweeter. There‚Äôs more about how I got into cooking and food on my &lt;a href=&quot;/aboutme.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;About Me&lt;/a&gt; page, but today, I‚Äôm here to share the memories attached to my favorite foods!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gon chow ngau huo&lt;/em&gt;, or beef chow fun, is a popular Cantonese dish that‚Äôs pretty much just fresh rice noodles, which are sticky if not constantly tossed in the wok, soy sauce, thin steak, mung bean sprouts, scallions, but packs a punch of flavor in every bite. I‚Äôve been eating this dish for as long as I can remember, yet I was not always a fan of it. My dad absolutely loves this dish, though, so it‚Äôs grown on me a ton. It tastes great with other roast meats, as seen in the char siu above too. Char siu is Cantonese honey-barbecued pork, which tastes great with plain rice or chopped in a fried rice. There are plenty of roast shops in Chinatown to buy both char siu + gon chow ngau huo, so I‚Äôll try to compile a list of shops for the future. It‚Äôs such a cheap meal, and there‚Äôs no better food deals than Chinatowns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‚ÄúShanghainese Trio‚Äù, the nickname I gave these three dishes, consists of &lt;em&gt;chong you bing&lt;/em&gt;, or scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, and &lt;em&gt;sheng jian bao&lt;/em&gt;, or pan-fried baos. I love these three dishes from Shanghai 21 (formerly Shanghai Asian Manor). I haven‚Äôt been there since it was known as the former, but their scallion pancakes are extremely crunchy and fluffy, and these baos and dumplings are stuffed with so much flavor. I can‚Äôt vouch for how these taste now, but regardless of if these dishes are made by my Grandma or at Shanghai 21, I will always keep these dishes on my favorites list.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheese tea, the drink phenomenon from China, is as interesting as it sounds. I hadn‚Äôt been to China since I was around 8 years old, but on my first trip to China in 2017, Antonia and I became obsessed after our first introduction to it. The ‚Äúcheese‚Äù is a sweet cream cheese foam sprinkled with salt, which adds a perfect savory note to the drink. I urge you to try this should the opportunity arise, and not to let the daunting title scare you away! &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.heytea.com/aboutUsEn.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HeyCha&lt;/a&gt;, originally from Guangdong and pictured above, is the pioneer of cheese tea in Asia, and people wait hours upon hours to grab a cup of it. It is very, very worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gai dan jai&lt;/em&gt;, or egg waffles, are an absolute contender for favorite dessert (excluding boba or cheese tea). The egg whites folded into the batter differentiate gai dan jai from standard Belgian waffles, along with a little custard powder and tapioca starch that create a slight chewiness. I had my first traditional HK egg waffle from Lee Keung Kee North Point Egg Waffles in Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong, and it definitely met my expectations. &lt;a href=&quot;http://wowfulls.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wowfulls&lt;/a&gt; has changed the egg waffle game in NYC, as they make egg waffle sundaes and have created pizza egg waffles in the past, so I encourage you to catch them at any upcoming popups!&lt;/p&gt;

I just love burnt ends, there‚Äôs not really another explanation üòÇ The steak and salad are from &lt;a href=&quot;https://arthurshoboken.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arthur‚Äôs Steakhouse&lt;/a&gt; in Hoboken. Before my dad made the full time switch to working from home (like over 14 years ago), he used to eat here for coworker meals and bring leftovers home for me and my sister. We became obsessed with their garlic bread, and eventually, got to eat in the restaurant. Arthur‚Äôs makes an incredible chicken caesar salad and ‚ÄúOur Steak‚Äù, a 24oz marbled Rib Eye, served with Arthur‚Äôs Potatoes. This is another restaurant I remember eating at for years, so I can‚Äôt wait to return one day and bite into their sometimes burnt, nonetheless tasty, potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This beautiful bacon, egg, and cheese bagel from Celebrity Bagels, a Tenafly staple, is one heck of special Sunday morning treat. I get mine with salt, pepper, and ketchup on an everything bagel, since I enjoy the variety of seasonings on top.&lt;/p&gt;

        Tofu Pudding
    &lt;/div&gt;    
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really got into &lt;em&gt;dou fu hua&lt;/em&gt;, or tofu pudding, this year, when my dad and I went to Chinatown in February. This was not my first time trying it, but I was not as &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; with it until then. Its primary ingredient is tofu, and although it may just seem like a bowl of soft tofu, it is really an extraordinary canvas for any condiments you like. The flavor itself is very neutral, meaning you can go either sweet or savory with it. Sweet dou fu hua is topped with a brown sugar syrup, which is how I typically eat it and is as seen above. Savory dou fu hua is topped with soy sauce, vinegar, chili oil, and scallions. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had the savory one, but it‚Äôs certainly one I‚Äôd love to try. My family likes it too, but I could eat the whole quart this pudding comes in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;flexoverlay&quot;&gt;Cheese-Baked Rice&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I figured I could finish this list off by tying it back to my roots. &lt;em&gt;Bao zai fan&lt;/em&gt;, or claypot rice, and &lt;em&gt;cheese-baked rice&lt;/em&gt; are two popular Hong Kong caf√© items. Claypot rice is typically topped with &lt;em&gt;lap cheong&lt;/em&gt;, or Chinese sausage, and &lt;em&gt;choi sum&lt;/em&gt;, or Chinese broccoli, but this one is topped with lamb chops and fried egg. We have a claypot at home, and it really makes meals special, since it sustains high temperatures. The pot browns the cooked rice, creating a nutty, toasty flavor unable to be replicated by just putting it in the oven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cheese-baked rice sounds a little odd, but everything about it works. It‚Äôs almost like a cheese pizza with a rice base. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of Asian tomato sauces are a lot sweeter than their Italian counterparts, and the sauce on this one has a light bell pepper note as well. I‚Äôm not a fan of peppers at all, but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; eat them if they‚Äôre in this rice. The cheese is almost a nod to Hong Kong‚Äôs ‚ÄúEast Meets West‚Äù background, when HK was a Crown Colony of the British empire. My parents lived in Guangzhou, and much of my maternal extended family lives in Hong Kong today, so eating these dishes is a taste of my Hong Kong memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs think Chipotle, but elevated with fresh-from-the-sea fish and so many more combinations. I discovered &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eatpokecrew.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Poke Crew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äôs grand opening through local food media company, &lt;a href=&quot;https://boozyburbs.com&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boozy Burbs&lt;/a&gt;, and I don‚Äôt think I had ever been so excited for a local restaurant opening up until that point. I had always wanted to go to Hawaii, not only because of its gorgeous landscape, but because of its rich culture that I would certainly love to explore one day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pronounced ‚Äúpoh - kay‚Äù, poke means ‚Äúto slice or cut‚Äù in Hawaiian and is typically marinated meat and seafood chunks. The two creators of Poke Crew come from a Michelin-star, NYC fine-dining background, but were excited to establish this casual dining concept in Bergen County. It may not be the first poke restaurant in Bergen County, but Poke Crew is definitely one of the most popular and high-quality here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Poke Crew does have pre-set bowls for people who want to make fewer decisions in a day, everything is made-to-order, so custom bowls are endlessly possible. Once you walk past the Polaroid-adorned walls, you can go to the starting line and pick-up a laminated menu, where you can then use a marker to choose the items you‚Äôd like to put in your bowl. They have so many seafood options, ranging from the popular salmon and tuna (both cubed &amp;amp; spicy tuna) to scallops, but also non-seafood options, like Berkshire pork belly, chicken teriyaki, tofu, + more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After picking your protein, you have a choice of 6 toppings, 2 sauces, and 4 garnishes. They have 20-ish toppings, 16 sauces, and 15 garnishes to choose from, so you‚Äôll definitely have some have some decision making to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Salmon Poke Bowl: full order below!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My typical order at Poke Crew is a white sushi rice, lettuce-based bowl with either chicken or salmon, corn, inari (sweet tofu), mango, pineapple, pickled ginger, scallion, wasabi yuzu soy, either honey pineapple mayo or yuzukosh≈ç (fermented chili-yuzu paste) mayo, crispy shallot, candied walnut (one of my favorites), nori, and finally, everything bagel spice. Every topping adds a different dimension to the bowl. Chicken may be untraditional, but their chicken is not just a boiled or grilled chicken breast tossed with sauces. The chicken is Searzall-blowtorched for caramelization and extra flavor, making this not your average pulled chicken bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason I love Poke Crew is their transformation of popular dishes, like honey walnut shrimp, to poke bowls, where they use cooked shrimp, honey pineapple mayo, and glazed walnuts. They also have an ‚ÄúEl Taco‚Äù bowl with white tuna, sweet corn, jalape√±o, chipotle mayo, tortilla, &amp;amp; more, and all of these pre-bowls can be substituted based on your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don‚Äôt have to be a seafood fan to come here. Even just trying out the tofu or chicken bowl first is a great stepping stone into opting for the seafood here. If you enjoy chains like Cava or Chipotle, there‚Äôs no reason why you won‚Äôt love Poke Crew too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Brazilian cheese bread, &lt;strong&gt;p√£o de queijo&lt;/strong&gt;, this naturally gluten-free tapioca cheese bread is not what you might first think of when you hear ‚Äúbread‚Äù, but its airiness, chewiness, and exterior crunchiness will be sure to win over even the most passionate bread purists. I want to preface this by saying this cheese bread is by no means authentic or traditional, but it still contains the two basic ingredients of cheese and tapioca flour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;brazilian-cheese-bread-history-according-to-eater-the-first-instance-of-p√£o-de-queijo-was-likely-produced-with-the-tapioca-starch-17th-century-slave-communities-collected-during-the-processing-of-cassava-plants-to-supplement-their-meager-daily-rations-but-cheese-wasnt-incorporated-until-the-beginning-of-the-20th-century&quot;&gt;Brazilian Cheese Bread History: According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eater.com/2016/8/8/12402578/pao-de-queijo-brazilian-cheese-bread-gluten-free&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eater&lt;/a&gt;, the first instance of p√£o de queijo was likely produced with the tapioca starch 17th-century slave communities collected ‚Äúduring the processing of cassava plants to supplement their meager daily rations‚Äù, but cheese wasn‚Äôt incorporated until the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recipe is as simple as it gets for bread. As long as you have tapioca flour, the other ingredients are very likely already in your pantry/fridge. I adapted this recipe from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/98554/brazilian-cheese-bread-pao-de-queijo/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Allrecipes.com&lt;/a&gt;, whose second step requires a saucepan to boil the liquid ingredients together, but a microwave to melt the butter did the trick for me. After that, it‚Äôs just a progression of dumping ingredients into a bowl and pouring the batter into a muffin tin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend using a Pyrex liquid measuring cup to do all your mixing in, as it makes pouring into a muffin tin even easier, but a regular mixing bowl and spoon will do the job as well. The recipe I adapted mine from implies that the mixture should be solid enough to drop small balls of it onto a sheet pan, but mine comes out as a thicker-than-cake batter. Regardless, I‚Äôve never had a time where I didn‚Äôt absolutely devour these bread bites, so I‚Äôm doing something right!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a quick 18 minutes in the oven later, and you‚Äôll find a toasted cheese aroma circulating through your kitchen. The golden-brown tops will let you know that they‚Äôre ready to go - the inside may be &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; underbaked, but there should be no liquid left whatsoever. This cheese bread is incredibly addictive - I make them to ‚Äúshare‚Äù with my dad, but once I start, I can‚Äôt hold myself back from eating more, which my grandma gets very upset about when I need to eat dinner in the next 20 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôve been perfectly shaped by the muffin mold the past two times I‚Äôve made these, but even if they come out with a hole on the bottom, I promise they‚Äôre still DELICIOUS! I used too much butter the first couple times, which is partly why the ones below are more golden (no complaints there). You can see the difference in the photos below. Plus, you can use the hole as a vehicle for any condiments you might want to add.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let‚Äôs get on with the recipe and &lt;em&gt;cheese&lt;/em&gt; the day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;yields-12-breads-in-a-mini-muffin-tin&quot;&gt;Yields 12 breads in a mini muffin tin&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 cup tapioca flour&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 tablespoons warm melted butter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Öì cup milk or soy milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Öì cup grated Parmesan or gouda cheese (more or less, based on your preferred cheesiness)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 beaten egg&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;¬Ω teaspoon salt&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;‚Öõ teaspoon of granulated garlic (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Directions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Preheat your oven to 375¬∞F, or 190¬∞C.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Combine milk, warm melted butter, beaten egg, and salt.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be sure to thoroughly mix, as you do not want the egg to cook at all.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir in the tapioca flour in two parts and mix until smooth.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Luckily, you don‚Äôt have to worry about overmixing as you would with regular bread, since there‚Äôs no gluten in this recipe!&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Combining tapioca flour and liquids can create a slimy texture, so you may struggle to mix at first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Add the cheese of your choice and stir well.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve only tried Parmesan and gouda, but any lower-moisture cheeses would definitely work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fill each mold basically full, but not to the point where any batter spreads out of the individual cup.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bake until the tops are lightly golden brown for 15-20 minutes. Aren‚Äôt they &lt;em&gt;cheesy&lt;/em&gt; on the eyes?
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Because of the butter and oils from the cheese, the breads should come right out of a non-stick muffin tray.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serve with honey, jam, or marinara sauce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Hokkaido Cheese in Japan, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/pinkladycheesetart/?hl=en&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pinklady Cheese Tart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a new Chinatown small business selling creamy cheese tarts located at 11 Mott Street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be unfamiliar with the Hokkaido cheese tarts that Pinklady is inspired by. Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island, has a massive countryside that can support a successful dairy industry. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e5312.html&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;japan-guide.com&lt;/a&gt;, the island produce‚Äôs half of Japan‚Äôs milk, and their dairy products are highly regarded across the country. The tarts supposedly originated in a bakery in Hokkaido‚Äôs capital of Sapporo, obviously using those quality dairy products. Hokkaido is one of my top bucket-list destinations, not only for the food, but for the nature (flowers, volcanoes, etc.), hot springs, skiing, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cheese tarts should not be confused with the popular Hong Kong egg tarts or Portuguese/Macanese past√©is de nata, as those tarts are filled with a silky sweet custard, while cheese tarts are made with oozy cheese mousse. The crusts on the other two are typically puff pastry-like, while cheese tart shells are more comparable to a cookie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;fun-fact-these-tarts-typically-contain-three-types-of-cheese-cream-cheese-mascarpone-cheese-and-the-most-surprising-one-parmesan-cheese-the-parmesan-does-not-make-these-tarts-savory---i-think-that-a-small-amount-adds-slight-saltiness-and-nuttiness-that-balances-the-sweetness-of-this-dessert&quot;&gt;Fun fact: these tarts typically contain THREE types of cheese: cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, and the most surprising one, parmesan cheese! The parmesan does NOT make these tarts savory - I think that a small amount adds slight saltiness and nuttiness that balances the sweetness of this dessert.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first experience with a cheese tart was in Taiwan, where I tried a boba-filled one - if you know me, you know I love boba on anything and everything. Although the boba added a chewy texture, it was the cheese itself that really stood out. Since then, I‚Äôve been on the look out for a cheese tart near me. When I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/CDmiUUdHTPM/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/jeaniuseats/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@jeaniuseats&lt;/a&gt;, I was ECSTATIC!! The location of Pinklady was perfect, as my dad and I stop by Mott Street almost monthly, so I made it a target stop on our next trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pinklady may not be the first cheese tart in Manhattan, but they are one of the only NYC businesses really specializing in cheese tarts. They only sell two products, one being their array of tarts, and the other being their housemade rice yogurt drinks, which I‚Äôve heard lovely things about too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store‚Äôs giant yellow sign sticks out like a sore thumb on Chinatown‚Äôs ‚Äúunofficial Main Street‚Äù that‚Äôs decorated with the lucky Chinese color of red all over. There‚Äôs no seating inside, which I wouldn‚Äôt expect to change after the pandemic, given the store‚Äôs small space. There‚Äôs a few back-of-the-house staff, but it‚Äôs been one person taking my order and packing it up the two times I‚Äôve been there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me start off by saying the staff there are so friendly - they really care about making sure you know all the temperatures you can enjoy your tarts at (more on that later) and just making you feel like a human, which is not always an easy find at bakeries and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon entrance, you‚Äôll see that there are ‚Äúsneeze guard‚Äù dividers to protect the tarts from any customers (who must wear a mask inside too), and the tarts are lined up on Silpats and plastic trays. They currently offer five flavors of &lt;strong&gt;original cheese&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;matcha&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ube&lt;/strong&gt; (purple yam), &lt;strong&gt;chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;strawberry-filled chocolate&lt;/strong&gt;. I‚Äôve tried all but the chocolate one, since I‚Äôm not the &lt;em&gt;biggest&lt;/em&gt; fan of chocolate (I‚Äôm prepared to get some hate mail‚Ä¶). My favorite is the matcha, because the matcha accompanies the cheese perfectly, but you really can‚Äôt go wrong with any of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Inside of the Matcha Cheese&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, about those temperatures I was talking about, there are four ways to enjoy these tarts. It‚Äôs almost like four different dessert types that range from firm + cheesecake-like to molten lava tarts. Putting the tart in the fridge will make the flowy inside firm up like a cheesecake, while putting it in the oven / air-fryer will make the inside hot and ooze of lava cheese. The other two ways are the most similar, which are just warming the tarts up in the microwave and eating it plain-Jane room temperature. My personal favorite is room-temperature, because I still get a slightly flowy inside while the tart retains a cheesecake-esque texture on the outer parts of the filling, but even just the versatility of how this dessert can be consumed is so unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do love myself a flaky HK egg tart crust, Pinklady double bakes their tart shells, making for a crispier, slightly toasted tartlet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was beyond satisfied with my stop at Pinklady. My dad and I fought over the last cheese tart, because they‚Äôre just that good (we ended up splitting it). Opening at the peak of the pandemic in April is no easy feat, and although there are many old staples in Chinatown that deserve an equal amount of appreciation, Pinklady is a great addition to an already fantastic, robust neighborhood dessert scene. Be sure to pay a visit at your next stop in Chinatown!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yama-nyc.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yama Sushi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is definitely a spot you‚Äôd skip over at first glance. It has an unassuming, dark exterior to go along with its basement location, so it wouldn‚Äôt be somewhere I‚Äôd choose initially, but this restaurant is my dad‚Äôs favorite place in New York. About 20 years ago, my dad used to commute to work in Manhattan before he switched to working at home, but he discovered Yama with his coworkers in the early days of his job. The basement-esque location we go to now is different than the one he used to go to, but he says this one is just as good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad loves to eat fish, especially sashimi, and even though I‚Äôm really not a big fan of fish, I do like sashimi and sushi. I hope that I‚Äôll be able to explore Japan one day to try authentic food, but for now, Yama serves high-quality, thinly sliced sashimi fish that keeps my family super happy. The ‚Äú&lt;strong&gt;sashimi entree&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äù of assorted sashimi is my dad‚Äôs favorite meal to eat. The sashimi is sliced thinner than a lot of sushi restaurants do, with pieces that are longer too. They are served on top of perilla leaves that are a perfect palate cleanser, and eating rice in between slices is recommended too. I wish I could tell you the types of fish in this selection, but I can definitely say there‚Äôs salmon and tuna (sorry!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/yamasushi/yamasashimi.JPG&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;
        Sashimi Entree!
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my sister and dad get the sashimi entree, I opt for a &lt;strong&gt;hot dish-sushi combo bento box&lt;/strong&gt;. A bento is simply a box of an assortment of rice/noodles, meat, &amp;amp; vegetables that‚Äôs very popular throughout East Asia. The photo at the very top is the lunch version, where you can choose 2 entrees out of many options, such as tonkatsu, ginger pork, tempura, sushi, hamachi kama, just to name a few. I love their chicken karaage, and even though I haven‚Äôt had a huge amount of karaage, this is my personal favorite! I also get their sushi, which is nigiri-style, which is just a slice of raw fish over sushi rice. I have noticed that the raw fish used on the sushi is warmer and not as high-quality as the sashimi alone, but it‚Äôs still great. The steam from the rice does wlightly warm the raw fish a bit, so it‚Äôs not the very chilled temperature that the sashimi retains. The box is accompanied with fresh orange slices and broiled fish - even for those aren‚Äôt the biggest fish fans (me), this fish is so tender, flaky, and well-flavored!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dinner boxes work a little differently, as you don‚Äôt get as much control on what comes with the box, besides your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki and sushi or sashimi. The box comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, fried shrimp shumai, rice, and ginger dressed salad. It‚Äôs perfect for people who want to sample multiple things, which is great for people who are a little indecisive when it comes to food (me, again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish we‚Äôve tried is the &lt;strong&gt;spicy tuna crispy rice&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the most popular dishes in American-Japanese restaurants, Yama makes it look incredibly fancy. This dish is just a fried sushi rice ‚Äúplatform‚Äù topped with spicy tuna and more mayo/chives. It‚Äôs pretty simple, but it‚Äôs a dish that combines crunch with some light spice. I think it‚Äôs a great introduction to those who‚Äôve never had raw fish!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been going to Yama for a few years now, and I really feel fully satisfied every time. Japanese food is something that can be so excited, and while I‚Äôm not sure that Yama is super authentic, I can confidently say that they serve very high-quality fish that is sliced a little differently than your typical sushi restaurant. Yama is a very relaxed setting, and the portions are well-priced for the amount. If you work in the city or are just in the mood for a casual sushi lunch with quality you know you can trust, Yama is your place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="nyceats" /><summary type="html">Yama Sushi is definitely a spot you‚Äôd skip over at first glance. It has an unassuming, dark exterior to go along with its basement location, so it wouldn‚Äôt be somewhere I‚Äôd choose initially, but this restaurant is my dad‚Äôs favorite place in New York. About 20 years ago, my dad used to commute to work in Manhattan before he switched to working at home, but he discovered Yama with his coworkers in the early days of his job. The basement-esque location we go to now is different than the one he used to go to, but he says this one is just as good! My dad loves to eat fish, especially sashimi, and even though I‚Äôm really not a big fan of fish, I do like sashimi and sushi. I hope that I‚Äôll be able to explore Japan one day to try authentic food, but for now, Yama serves high-quality, thinly sliced sashimi fish that keeps my family super happy. The ‚Äúsashimi entree‚Äù of assorted sashimi is my dad‚Äôs favorite meal to eat. The sashimi is sliced thinner than a lot of sushi restaurants do, with pieces that are longer too. They are served on top of perilla leaves that are a perfect palate cleanser, and eating rice in between slices is recommended too. I wish I could tell you the types of fish in this selection, but I can definitely say there‚Äôs salmon and tuna (sorry!). Sashimi Entree! While my sister and dad get the sashimi entree, I opt for a hot dish-sushi combo bento box. A bento is simply a box of an assortment of rice/noodles, meat, &amp;amp; vegetables that‚Äôs very popular throughout East Asia. The photo at the very top is the lunch version, where you can choose 2 entrees out of many options, such as tonkatsu, ginger pork, tempura, sushi, hamachi kama, just to name a few. I love their chicken karaage, and even though I haven‚Äôt had a huge amount of karaage, this is my personal favorite! I also get their sushi, which is nigiri-style, which is just a slice of raw fish over sushi rice. I have noticed that the raw fish used on the sushi is warmer and not as high-quality as the sashimi alone, but it‚Äôs still great. The steam from the rice does wlightly warm the raw fish a bit, so it‚Äôs not the very chilled temperature that the sashimi retains. The box is accompanied with fresh orange slices and broiled fish - even for those aren‚Äôt the biggest fish fans (me), this fish is so tender, flaky, and well-flavored! The dinner boxes work a little differently, as you don‚Äôt get as much control on what comes with the box, besides your choice of beef or chicken teriyaki and sushi or sashimi. The box comes with shrimp and vegetable tempura, fried shrimp shumai, rice, and ginger dressed salad. It‚Äôs perfect for people who want to sample multiple things, which is great for people who are a little indecisive when it comes to food (me, again).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://taiyakinyc.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taiyaki NYC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is known for their Japanese fish-shaped cones filled with soft serve ice cream. The texture of the cones are a little bit like waffles, but so much better. Traditionally, they‚Äôre stuffed with anko, or sweet red azuki bean paste, but Taiyaki offers them with custard filling too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚Ä¶BUT! Today, we‚Äôre talking about their fluffy pancakes! Although they‚Äôve been popular in Japan for a while now, fluffy pancakes have just started making their splash in New York City. It‚Äôs really no surprise that these pancakes are gaining so much popularity - their taller-than-average height and jiggly movement make for a fun dish to eat. This is achieved through separating the egg yolks from the egg whites, the latter of which is beaten until stiff peaks are attained. This meringue is gently folded into the batter, which makes these pancakes extra fluffy because of the air bubbles formed during this process. However, these pancakes are so much more than their stunning appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked that these pancakes were just as tasty as how stunning they looked. Given that a good part of the batter is that meringue, my initial expectation was that it would mostly taste of egg whites. I really was surprised by the great balance in taste - they have a really subtle, but just strong enough, sweetness, custard-y taste, and slight browning on the outside. Since I don‚Äôt like my desserts too sweet, these pancakes really were everything I wanted!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/nyceats/pancake/fluffywhite.JPG&quot; height=&quot;150px&quot; class=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiyaki NYC offers these pancakes in two ways. The pancakes I tried were topped with a soft matcha cream sauce and a crispy mini anko-filled taiyaki, and served with a side of whipped cream, but you can also get them your classic style with a pat of butter, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and a side of syrup. Since these pancakes are just so good on their own, either way will taste absolutely fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found out about these pancakes that were taking NYC by storm through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taiyakinyc&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@taiyakinyc&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram and was incredibly excited to try them out, but Taiyaki NYC only sells these cakes from Fridays to Sundays, 11am-2pm at their Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Boston locations for now, to ensure that their product is quality-controlled. So, my first souffl√© pancake experience was actually at the Smorgasburg Outdoor Food Market that takes place from late March to October in Williamsburg. A stand, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Fluffysnyc/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fluffy‚Äôs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, was a new vendor for the 2019 season that specializes in souffl√© pancakes. The only difference I could find was that Fluffy‚Äôs pancakes were slightly undercooked, which you even might be able to notice in the photo below. This is probably due to the overwhelming lines at their stand - Fluffy‚Äôs was undoubtedly one of the most popular vendors at the market. Fluffy‚Äôs also offers a lot more variety in flavors offered, including blueberry cheesecake (pictured below), cr√®me br√ªl√©e (yes, sounds incredible!), Nutella, and a rotating vegan option too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever you find your fluffy souffl√© pancakes, I have no doubt that you‚Äôll enjoy them. From what I‚Äôve seen, a reasonable &lt;em&gt;New York City&lt;/em&gt; price for about 2 pancakes will run ~$10-$12. I‚Äôve seen some places run their prices up to $20 for two, not so tall, fluffy pancakes, which I can‚Äôt justify buying whatsoever. Taiyaki NYC makes an absolutely fantastic pancake, as does Fluffy‚Äôs *, and I highly recommend that if the time (Fridays-Sundays, 11am-2pm) and price work for you, have these pancakes as a really lovely end-of-the-week treat ü•û.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With over 700 locations world wide, the global franchise restaurant chain, Gyu-Kaku, is definitely not unique to NYC, but I do live close to the city, so Manhattan is the most accessible place for me to enjoy their Japanese barbecue. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gyu-kaku.com/&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;restaurant‚Äôs website&lt;/a&gt;, the name, Gyu-Kaku, means ‚ÄúHorn of the Bull‚Äù in Japanese. The chain strives to replicate an authentic yakiniku, or grilled meat barbecue, dining experience that isn‚Äôt so easy to find outside of Japan. Although I‚Äôve never been to Japan, what matters is that Gyu-Kaku still serves high-quality dishes prepared with lots of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real charm about this place is how worth it the food is, ESPECIALLY if you go during their ‚ÄúHappy Hour‚Äù, where they offer many dishes at a discounted price (GO DURING HAPPY HOUR!!). You get so much food for a reasonable price, making this one of my all-time favorite meals. I leave feeling so whole-hearted every time without my dad needing to spend way too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Gyu-Kaku, yakiniku is grill-it-yourself! You can &lt;em&gt;kind of&lt;/em&gt; think about it like Korean BBQ, but the taste is REALLY quite different from Korean barbecue. However, if you like KBBQ, I have no doubts that you‚Äôll LOVE yakinuku! They are both very unique dining experiences, as in my opinion, a Korean BBQ meal is only complete with a large set of banchan side dishes, such as your typical kimchi, Kongnamul bean sprouts, mung bean jelly, among MANY, many others (I am by no means an expert on either KBBQ or yakiniku, so I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing a lot) that are meant to be enjoyed alongside the meal, whereas yakiniku can be enjoyed with simpler accompaniments.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The Layout&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first order of business: the meat! They offer TONS of different types of meat, such as chicken, duck, pork belly, salmon, BBQ calamari, Japanese-style pork sausage, and of course, beef. I would say the stars of the show are the beef preparations, however, as their beef options range from classic thin beef tongue to premium USDA Prime kalbi short ribs. You can choose from meat marinated in their signature marinades* OR just naked meat with some salt + pepper - you can‚Äôt go wrong with either!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;-all-of-their-sauces--marinades-are-gluten-free&quot;&gt;* All of their sauces + marinades are gluten-free!!&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal favorite meat (beef) options are the garlic-marinated bistro hanger steak, ultra-thin, super-fatty toro beef, and of course for a treat, the kalbi short ribs marinated in sweet soy tare. Those might be my favorites, but ANY of their meat options, beyond just beef, are absolutely fantastic. Do yourself a favor and take advantage of the sauce bottle trio on the side of your table!! The best sauce is the combo of all three, ponzu, sweet soy, and ‚Äúspicy‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that as a yakiniku restaurant, the premise behind the whole place is their grilled meat. But the things that keep me coming back are their incredible plates of cooked dishes that make you feel so cozy inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been coming to Gyu-Kaku for as long as I can remember. My mom used to work in the city, and this spot was a favorite among her and her coworkers. When my sister and I were first introduced, we couldn‚Äôt stop coming back!! So this place really brings back a lot of fond memories that make my heart warm every time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;Is your mouth watering yet?!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first dish that I‚Äôd like to talk about is their &lt;strong&gt;garlic noodles&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me tell you, if Gyu-Kaku ONLY sold these noodles, I‚Äôd be okay with it. This is the first dish I ever ate Gyu-Kaku, and I‚Äôve loved them for as long as I can remember. The dish is made with thick, udon-style, egg noodles that are coated in a slightly sweetened garlic sauce and vegetables. You have the choice of ground chicken, vegetables, or shrimp. They‚Äôre served on a cast-iron plate, which slightly browns the outsides of the noodles.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimageoverlay&quot;&gt;The &quot;Volcano&quot;!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dish I love is their absolutely non-traditional, but no less mouthwatering, &lt;strong&gt;spicy tuna volcano&lt;/strong&gt;. It‚Äôs a crispy fried block of rice topped with spicy tuna over a layer of Japanese shoyu BBQ sauce. Enough said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two dishes are some of their best-sellers, and it‚Äôs not difficult to see why. These might be my two favorites, but not far behind (at all) are any of their &lt;strong&gt;bibimbap rice dishes&lt;/strong&gt; that achieve glorious browning from their hot stone bowls and their &lt;strong&gt;tuna poke nachos&lt;/strong&gt; - something about a fried wonton skin just feels right, you know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gyu-Kaku will forever have a special place in my heart, as it has been since I was young. This restaurant chain makes food that is so effortlessly comforting and tasty. I can confidently say that I‚Äôve never had a bad dish from here, despite the overwhelmingly large menu. Even though the place isn‚Äôt catered towards vegetarians, they make some great grilled veggies (with or without a touch of butter), of which I recommend the corn, and salads too. If you aren‚Äôt stuffed by the end, they also serve great desserts, like cr√™pe cake slices from Lady M and chocolate lava cakes, of which I‚Äôve included photos below. I highly recommmend this place for any and all occasions, as they serve well-priced food that leaves you feeling happier than a traditional ‚Äú5-star‚Äù meal would.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: Just to clarify, these photos are from several different times I‚Äôve eaten at Gyu-Kaku over the years.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Seattle</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Seattle" /><published>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2020-06-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/beyond/seattle">&lt;div class=&quot;flex-container&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to one of my favorite cities!! üòä While it‚Äôs known for the constant rain, the Seattle summer weather is absolutely perfect - mid-70s, shining sun until 9PM, and minimal rain. What you wouldn‚Äôt expect, though, are the unique attractions, beautiful landscape, and some of the best food you‚Äôll find around! See all the places I went below‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Okay, but first, dessert - who said dessert can't come first?! &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;Molly Moon's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, one of Seattle's most popular ice cream shops, was the first on my list.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;According to their website, their &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mollymoon.com/flavors&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Yeti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; ice cream flavor is their signature sweet cream ice cream, but swirled with vanilla bean caramel and &quot;yeti&quot; granola, which are both made in-house, along with Theo chocolate bits. They make the creamiest ice cream, and knowing that everything is sourced locally, with no artificial additives, makes this ice cream even more lovable!!&lt;/p&gt;

This restaurant is one of my favorites from Asia, as my dad introduced it to me on our trip to China in 2018. I had always been a fan of xiaolongbao, but there's something so special about the way DTF prepares their ultra-thin wrappers and piping hot soup inside. While DTF is pricy for xiaolongbao, many will agree that indulging in these small dumplings of heaven are worth it. Please, DTF, come to the East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;singleimagecontainer&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I got just the plain Kurobata pork soup dumplings (the cheapest XLB option), but they also sell crab + pork ones that are my favorite kind. DTF also serves an even more indulgent option - the truffle Kurobata pork ones. If you love the unique taste of truffle, these are definitely for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Known for their breakfast bar, customers that order off the &quot;breakfast bar&quot; section are able to top their meal off with a &quot;selection of seasonal fruit, nuts, &amp;amp; whipped cream&quot;. I ordered the bananas foster french toast and topped it off with their fresh strawberries - so apPEELing üòã&lt;/p&gt;

They are a dessert shop serving up the highest quality molten chocolate cakes, cookies, thick milkshakes, and warm dessert drinks. Their original cake, which was first served back in 2008, the Dark Decadence, is crafted with Theo chocolate, dry-burned caramel, nib toffee, + vanilla ice cream. They pride themselves on their dry-burned caramel, which takes long periods of intense concentration and patience (you can read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://getyourhotcakes.com/pages/dry-burned-caramel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). It's worth it though - you can taste the quality in each bite of this cake + its sidekicks. &lt;strong&gt;A must-stop when in Seattle!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;To kick-off Intern Family Weekend, Facebook Seattle hosted a Kick-Off Social. We enjoyed appetizers (which we &lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; turned into a meal) provided by Facebook catering. All the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-cafeteria-food-is-amazing-2015-2&quot; class=&quot;nounderline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hype about the Facebook cafeterias&lt;/a&gt; is for a reason - they're redefining the term &lt;em&gt;cafeteria&lt;/em&gt;.
