I've now returned from my time out west to go to college! Living in Los Angeles was on my list of dreams for many years. Just before I moving to LA in January 2022, I didn’t know this dream would become my reality so soon. Catch some of the fun adventure I had (because there's lots to be shared) 😊 

I love you, LA!
